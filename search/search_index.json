The openSUSE distributions are no exception: The official and unofficial repositories, which you interact with from zypper , and which provide binaries packaged as RPM files. Third-party installers, which you interact with from a command prompt by downloading files (for example, with wget , curl , or git ). These may provide you with a something ready to install, complete with binaries and installation scripts. Alternatively, they may only include source code and build scripts which you have to compile yourself. Flatpak is a delivery tool for containerized desktop application. It provides apps packaged up with all their dependencies. You typically interact with it using the flatpak command-line utility. Snapcraft is Ubuntu's equivalent to Flatpak. It similarly provides apps in single files, containerized with their dependencies. You typically interact with it using the snapd command-line utility. AppImages are a vendor-neutral, cross-distro app format. Apps are delivered as a single files, which you manually download from websites and various hosts. AppImages do not need any supporting tools, they only need to be marked executable. The goal of this document is to help you understand these formats and methods, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. We will also make a few openSUSE-specific recommendations along the way. Official and third-party RPM repositories \u2693\ufe0e RPM packages ( .rpm ) are the traditional and most common way of obtaining new software on openSUSE distributions. Installing RPM packages works like this: Find the repository providing the package you are looking for. If the package is provided by one of the official repositories, which are preconfigured in openSUSE, such as download.opensuse.org/update/tumbleweed/ , it will show up in zypper search <package_name> . If the package is not provided by an official repository, you will first need to add the repository. Tip Use zypper lr -d to list all your repositories and their addresses. Install the target package with sudo zypper in <package_name> . The openSUSE Software website \u2693\ufe0e The openSUSE project offers a website where contributors can find software packages for easy installation, especially those built using the openSUSE Build Service . The site can be found at software.opensuse.org . It offers a search engine and references to official and unofficial software repositories. In addition, in some cases, the tool also offers downloadable packages for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, or other Linux distributions. It also offers easy installation using the YaST administration tool of openSUSE. If a package is available for your version of openSUSE, click the link with the version number. This will download a .ymp file which your web browser should offer to open using the YaST software management tool. If not, you can click on the .ymp file in your file manager and YaST should open it. YaST will then add any necessary repositories, asking you for permission in the process, and then install the program and its dependencies. For free and open-source software, using this is usually easier than manually adding a third-party repository. In some cases, you may also find packages of proprietary freeware. However, if you need a proprietary application, such as Google Chrome, Skype, or Microsoft Teams, you should obtain it directly from the vendor. If they have a Linux repository, you can add it to your system, or download and install an RPM directly. Important After installing from a .ymp file, you will remain subscribed to all RPM repositories referenced in that file. In many cases, the package you wanted to install initially isn't the only RPM provided by the repository. Carelessly updating (with zypper up or zypper dup ) afterwards can lead to surprising changes in your software selection. This is especially when you accidentally subscribe to repositories meant for different distribution versions. Using repositories from third-party providers \u2693\ufe0e Certain application providers offer RPM packages and RPM repositories themselves. In some cases, the RPM package will not only install the desired application but also add the RPM repository to the system, enabling application updates. For example, Google provides the official Chrome package this way. After downloading an RPM package, check it. Most trustworthy providers cryptographically sign their RPMs, providing you with an .asc file containing a public key. This lets you verify that the package has not been tampered with: $ rpm --import <the-package-public-key>.asc $ rpm --checksig <the-rpm-package-file>.rpm To install the package, point zypper to the RPM file: sudo zypper in ~/Downloads/<package>.rpm We recommend that you enable the refresh setting for the repositories of the applications you use most. If you don't do this, in some configurations, sudo zypper dup will not automatically acquire updates for the package provided by that repository. Find out the number of of the repo and whether the refresh setting is enabled: $ sudo zypper modifyrepo --refresh <repo_number> The first column of the table, # , indicates the repo number. The last column of the table, Refresh , indicates whether the refresh setting is enabled ( Yes ) or not ( No ). For repos that are not yet set to refresh automatically, enable the refresh setting: $ sudo zypper modifyrepo --refresh <repo_number> Pros, cons, when to use \u2693\ufe0e Pros: The most \"natural\" way to install programs in the openSUSE ecosystem. Has the best performance (startup time and execution speed) of all solutions. Uses the lowest amount of RAM and hard drive capacity. Cons: Heavily depends upon the libraries and other dependencies provided by your operating system. You may not be able to install the latest versions of some programs, because the supporting libraries provided by your distro are too old. Conversely, it can also mean that drastic changes in your system-wide dependencies might prevent the program from running at all. Depends on the availability of the distribution packagers and maintainers Other solutions are more developer-driven or benefit from cross-distribution maintainership ( Flatpaks , Snaps and AppImages ). You depend on the maintainers and software-packagers of your distribution. Other solutions are more developer-driven or benefit from cross-distribution maintenance ( Flatpaks , Snaps and AppImages ). Best used when: The software you are installing is a core utility or library (e.g. curl , gcc , python-devel ). You know that you won't need several versions of the software installed at the same time. You need stability and minimal resource usage. You can afford a marginally slower update pace than with other solutions. Third-party remote providers \u2693\ufe0e We use \"third-party remote providers\" to mean websites, services or remote machines offering automatic installation using scripts provided along with the desired application. Since the details of the installation depend on custom-made installation scripts, your experience with this method can vary significantly from one provider to another. Thoroughly follow the instructions mentioned by the provider. For example, installing the Rust developer stack is a simple as copying and pasting this command into a terminal window: $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh Then follow the interactive instructions. Warning Installation scripts might require sudo rights. Be mindful about what you are installing, and from whom and where you obtained it. Pros, cons, when \u2693\ufe0e Pros: Has the best performance (startup time and execution speed) of all solutions. Uses the lowest amount of RAM and hard drive capacity. Cons: No control over the behaviour of the script, especially if the script asks to be run as sudo . This can incur some risk. Heavily depends upon libraries and other dependencies provided by your operating system. This means that drastic changes in your system-wide dependencies might prevent the program from running at all. Best used when: You are 100% sure you can trust the provider. The software you are installing is a command-line tool that is not integral to the system. You know that you won't need several versions of the software installed at the same time. You need maximal performance and minimal resource usage. Flatpaks \u2693\ufe0e Flatpak is a complete solution for installing, updating and running desktop applications from a containerized environment (see flatpak official documentation for more information). It makes use of the following components: The flatpak command line utility A remote application store at flathub.org Application references, such as com.spotify.Client , organized by the Flathub store A local repository used to store applications along with their dependencies (by default, /var/lib/flatpak ) On openSUSE distributions, you can install support for Flatpak as follows: Install the command line utility (not required if it's installed already; to double-check, see if flatpak --version returns something): $ sudo zypper in flatpak Add the Flathub store as an external flatpak repository: $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo Restart your system. From now on you will be able to install any of the numerous apps provided from Flathub , as in: $ flatpak install --user flathub com.spotify.Client Bear in mind: We recommend using the --user flag during the installation of Flatpaks. With the --user flag, applications are installed in your home directory. In combination with a separate /home partition, this means that applications will remain installed even when the root file system ( / ) is deleted during a new installation. Installing applications (with or without --user ) should automatically export a .desktop file to /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications and add the corresponding symlinks to your system. This means applications will show up in your desktop environment's application launchers and other menus right after you have installed them (no reboot required). To update Flatpaks, use: $ flatpak update To update a single Flatpak application, instead do: $ flatpak update <the.application.name> Additional details \u2693\ufe0e How it works \u2693\ufe0e The two main themes behind Flatpaks are binary versioning control and containerization . Binary versioning control (BVC) ensures that the system sees Flatpak applications not as files with a given name. It also that tracks them against the context of a full versioning control system, such as Git. Flatpak applications are thus much like Git branches, in that they \"wear their origin upon their sleeves\". For example, for the Spotify application, the flatpak command has the following tracking information: $ flatpak list Spotify com.spotify.Client 1.1.55.498.gf9a83c60 stable system This amounts to, in this order: A human-friendly name The exact name as defined by the provider The (Git) snapshot it is built from The (Git) branch hosting the snapshot (here, stable ) The installation site (here, it is installed for the system , which means it can be run by any other user of the machine). Under this constraint, any difference in the name or snapshot or branch or installation site will determine a different Flatpak application reference. Two applications that are byte-for-byte identical will not collide with one another if they are different in other aspects of their reference. This means that, at any point, you can identify the portion of the codebase from which the application stems and that is relevant to the binary you are running. This also means you can install multiple variants of one application through multiple application references side by side. The other main theme behind Flatpaks is containerization. Here, that means that Flatpak applications run in isolation from one another. This is made possible by taking advantage of the binary versioning control system mentioned above. Flatpak allows developers to specify a particular runtime for their app, which is the context against which their applications is to run, and that serves as a proxy for the full operating system. Because of BVC, developers are free to specify different runtimes for the same byte-to-byte identical binaries, or conversely, the same runtime for widely different binaries, should they happen to have similar requirements. The Flatpak system then makes sure that runtimes meet the requirements of the applications they are associated with by their developers, and are executing in mutually inaccessible memory spaces. Info While Flatpak applications share some dependencies if they share the same runtime, users can't ensure that all dependencies are shared between different applications. For users, there is also no way to ensure that different Flatpak applications use the same runtime, as dependencies on runtimes are specified by developers. This means that some duplication is to be expected, wasting some disk space. Improving desktop integration (KDE Plasma) \u2693\ufe0e The degree of independence that Flatpaks enjoy with respect to the host operating system means that some frictions may occur now and then. This is particularly true for applications (and runtimes) which do not play nice with recent rendering and compositing frameworks. For example, dragging and dropping a file for sending via a messaging application running as a Flatpak might not work as seamlessly as expected. For these corner cases, you can tinker with the runtime's parameters. Consider for example org.telegram.desktop . Should your version of this app seem to be affected by the above bug, you can try to run the application as: $ flatpak run --env=QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb org.telegram.desktop This instructs the runtime to use X11 instead of Wayland as the compositing client. There are many other environment parameters. To learn which to apply to a particular application, read the documentation and GitHub Issues for the Flatpak wrapper of the application. Info All Flatpak applications hosted on Flathub have a public repository (often on GitHub) where you can read GitHub Issues and participate in the conversation. Do not hesitate to go there now and then, as the tips you might learn are likely to serve you for many other Flatpak applications. When you are satisfied with the results, you can attach a runtime setting to an application permanently to the current user as in: $ flatpak override --user --env=QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb org.telegram.desktop (Remove the --user flag to apply the override system-wide.) This will ensure that the application is always run with the corresponding environment parameter. More on the override option in the official Flatpak documentation . Flatseal \u2693\ufe0e Flatseal allows changing Flatpak isolation parameters for applications. Please refer to Flatseal's official documentation . Pros, cons, when to use \u2693\ufe0e Pros: Decent performance (it runs as fast as \"bare\" binaries and launches almost as fast) Excellent safety for your operating system (because most dependencies are not shared with the host operating system and because Flatpaks installed with --user survive system reinstallations/restorations) Easy to update ( flatpak update ) Cons: Eats up significantly more hard drive space than the alternative methods and formats (because not all dependencies can be shared between Flatpaks) Sometimes rough around the edges in terms of integration with the desktop environment Best used when: You are using many applications with a graphical interface and you don't want to expose them or your system to conflicts of dependencies (useful for Tumbleweed and MicroOS, whose core packages change frequently). You want to have freshly updated and widely tested applications (the same as most other Linux distributions). You plan on using many user applications (the more Flatpaks you have, the more dependencies they can share). AppImage \u2693\ufe0e Warning AppImages are executable, file-like application bundles which are somewhat controversial in the Linux community for their lack of UI consistency with the host system and for the security risks they might incur. Furthermore they are not supported on MicroOS . For these reasons we recommend preferring other software procurement methods when possible. AppImage is the simplest cross-platform application package format. However, you need to do a little manual work. To install an AppImage, download it and marking it executable with: chmod +x <application_name>.AppImage To run the app, double-click it in your file manager, or run it from your terminal: ./<application_name>.AppImage To improve organization of your AppImages, create a dedicated directory for them in your home directory and move each file. The authors of AppImage recommend ~/Applications for this purpose. With AppImages, it is your responsibility to keep the app up-to-date. While some apps notify you when a new version becomes available, you will usually have to perform the following manually: Download the new version, move it into your desired folder and mark it executable If you have created any shortcuts or launchers, you will have to edit their settings to point to the new version. When everything works, delete the .AppImage file of the old version. Pros, cons, when \u2693\ufe0e Pros : AppImages need no supporting libraries, tooling, or commands. You can install, update, and remove them even without admin privileges on the computer. You can easily run multiple versions side-by-side, as version numbers are typically embedded in the filename. Cons : Maintenance is your responsibility: You have to update your apps yourself, manually. Some apps integrate well with the system, but this is not guaranteed. Launchers, file associations, etc. may have to be created by hand. Updating the app means manually changing launcher properties, creating new shortcuts, and so on. Making AppImages available to all users on a computer may take extra work. The AppImage format does not offer any kind of isolation or separation between apps. Best used when: The app is not available in RPM form, or the RPM assumes a different OS (such as Fedora) and will not install correctly. There is no Flatpak or Snap, or you don't have or don't want, the extra plumbing of Flatpak or Snap. You don't have privileges to install new software system-wide. Summary and conclusion \u2693\ufe0e Even though Leap and Tumbleweed's official repositories are numerous, you will find yourself in search of alternatives at times. Here are some simple rules of thumbs that emerge from the pros and cons discussed above. Installing Snaps, Flatpaks, or AppImages is a serious alternative to installing from official repositories if you are looking for a program which: Has a graphical interface Updates often Relies on dependencies that are not provided in official repositories Relies on dependencies that are more recent than those in official repositories This applies to both Leap and Tumbleweed's official repositories. When wondering which to use, between Snaps, Flatpaks and AppImages: Favour Flatpaks if you: Want a streamlined experience or precise maintenance options via the command line If you plan on using several other Flatpaks. The more Flatpaks using the same dependencies there are on your system, the more storage-efficient the format becomes. Favour AppImages if you need a handful of \"fire-and-forget\" or \"portable\" (no installation needed) applications.

It makes use of the following components: The flatpak command line utility A remote application store at flathub.org Application references, such as com.spotify.Client , organized by the Flathub store A local repository used to store applications along with their dependencies (by default, /var/lib/flatpak ) On openSUSE distributions, you can install support for Flatpak as follows: Install the command line utility (not required if it's installed already; to double-check, see if flatpak --version returns something): $ sudo zypper in flatpak Add the Flathub store as an external flatpak repository: $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo Restart your system. From now on you will be able to install any of the numerous apps provided from Flathub , as in: $ flatpak install --user flathub com.spotify.Client Bear in mind: We recommend using the --user flag during the installation of Flatpaks. With the --user flag, applications are installed in your home directory. In combination with a separate /home partition, this means that applications will remain installed even when the root file system ( / ) is deleted during a new installation. Installing applications (with or without --user ) should automatically export a .desktop file to /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications and add the corresponding symlinks to your system. This means applications will show up in your desktop environment's application launchers and other menus right after you have installed them (no reboot required). To update Flatpaks, use: $ flatpak update To update a single Flatpak application, instead do: $ flatpak update <the.application.name>","title":"Flatpaks"},{"location":"alternative_procurement/#additional-details","text":"","title":"Additional details"},{"location":"alternative_procurement/#how-it-works","text":"The two main themes behind Flatpaks are binary versioning control and containerization . Binary versioning control (BVC) ensures that the system sees Flatpak applications not as files with a given name. It also that tracks them against the context of a full versioning control system, such as Git. Flatpak applications are thus much like Git branches, in that they \"wear their origin upon their sleeves\". For example, for the Spotify application, the flatpak command has the following tracking information: $ flatpak list Spotify com.spotify.Client 1.1.55.498.gf9a83c60 stable system This amounts to, in this order: A human-friendly name The exact name as defined by the provider The (Git) snapshot it is built from The (Git) branch hosting the snapshot (here, stable ) The installation site (here, it is installed for the system , which means it can be run by any other user of the machine). Under this constraint, any difference in the name or snapshot or branch or installation site will determine a different Flatpak application reference. Two applications that are byte-for-byte identical will not collide with one another if they are different in other aspects of their reference. This means that, at any point, you can identify the portion of the codebase from which the application stems and that is relevant to the binary you are running. This also means you can install multiple variants of one application through multiple application references side by side. The other main theme behind Flatpaks is containerization. Here, that means that Flatpak applications run in isolation from one another. This is made possible by taking advantage of the binary versioning control system mentioned above. Flatpak allows developers to specify a particular runtime for their app, which is the context against which their applications is to run, and that serves as a proxy for the full operating system. Because of BVC, developers are free to specify different runtimes for the same byte-to-byte identical binaries, or conversely, the same runtime for widely different binaries, should they happen to have similar requirements. The Flatpak system then makes sure that runtimes meet the requirements of the applications they are associated with by their developers, and are executing in mutually inaccessible memory spaces. Info While Flatpak applications share some dependencies if they share the same runtime, users can't ensure that all dependencies are shared between different applications. For users, there is also no way to ensure that different Flatpak applications use the same runtime, as dependencies on runtimes are specified by developers. This means that some duplication is to be expected, wasting some disk space.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"alternative_procurement/#improving-desktop-integration-kde-plasma","text":"The degree of independence that Flatpaks enjoy with respect to the host operating system means that some frictions may occur now and then. This is particularly true for applications (and runtimes) which do not play nice with recent rendering and compositing frameworks. For example, dragging and dropping a file for sending via a messaging application running as a Flatpak might not work as seamlessly as expected. For these corner cases, you can tinker with the runtime's parameters. Consider for example org.telegram.desktop . Should your version of this app seem to be affected by the above bug, you can try to run the application as: $ flatpak run --env=QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb org.telegram.desktop This instructs the runtime to use X11 instead of Wayland as the compositing client. There are many other environment parameters. To learn which to apply to a particular application, read the documentation and GitHub Issues for the Flatpak wrapper of the application. Info All Flatpak applications hosted on Flathub have a public repository (often on GitHub) where you can read GitHub Issues and participate in the conversation. Do not hesitate to go there now and then, as the tips you might learn are likely to serve you for many other Flatpak applications. When you are satisfied with the results, you can attach a runtime setting to an application permanently to the current user as in: $ flatpak override --user --env=QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb org.telegram.desktop (Remove the --user flag to apply the override system-wide.) This will ensure that the application is always run with the corresponding environment parameter.

Furthermore they are not supported on MicroOS . For these reasons we recommend preferring other software procurement methods when possible. AppImage is the simplest cross-platform application package format. However, you need to do a little manual work. To install an AppImage, download it and marking it executable with: chmod +x <application_name>.AppImage To run the app, double-click it in your file manager, or run it from your terminal: ./<application_name>.AppImage To improve organization of your AppImages, create a dedicated directory for them in your home directory and move each file. The authors of AppImage recommend ~/Applications for this purpose. With AppImages, it is your responsibility to keep the app up-to-date. While some apps notify you when a new version becomes available, you will usually have to perform the following manually: Download the new version, move it into your desired folder and mark it executable If you have created any shortcuts or launchers, you will have to edit their settings to point to the new version.

Cons : Maintenance is your responsibility: You have to update your apps yourself, manually. Some apps integrate well with the system, but this is not guaranteed. Launchers, file associations, etc. may have to be created by hand. Updating the app means manually changing launcher properties, creating new shortcuts, and so on. Making AppImages available to all users on a computer may take extra work. The AppImage format does not offer any kind of isolation or separation between apps. Best used when: The app is not available in RPM form, or the RPM assumes a different OS (such as Fedora) and will not install correctly.

(Note that this step will remove all your installed flatpaks) $ flatpak remote-delete flathub Customize your .desktop files for a better user experience \u2693\ufe0e Most user applications shipping their own GUI install with a desktop file ( <program name>.desktop ) providing the application with some parameters discovered at the installation. Some of these parameters are key to a comfortable user experience. Consider for example Electron apps, which as of today (26th of July 2021) offload rendering to X11 instead of the Wayland client. This means that your Desktop Environment, which is likely to run with Wayland enabled by default, will not be able to make the most of the application's GUI. We can improve the situation as follows: Locate the application's desktop file, most likely at /usr/share/applications . For instance you can go a simple: $ ls /usr/share/applications | grep <program name>.desktop Once you're certain of the file name, copy it to ~/.local/share/applications : $ cp /usr/share/applications/<program name>.desktop ~/.local/share/applications There you can edit the program's .desktop file at leisure as it won't be overwritten when updating the target program (this contrasts with editing .desktop files directly under /usr/share/applications . For instance if you wanted VS Code -- an Electron application -- to use Wayland, you could change the line: Exec=/usr/share/code/code --unity-launch %F to Exec=/usr/share/code/code --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland It might take a reboot for your applications to register changes to their .desktop file. Codecs \u2693\ufe0e openSUSE distributions do not ship with proprietary software, and for most cases there are Free and Open Source alternatives, such as the free codecs shipped with certain applications (most modern web browsers such as the Chromium-based ones and Firefox).

To do this we recommend using the opi -- Open Build Service Package Installer, which is able to fetch software sitting just outside of the official system repositories: sudo zypper in opi opi codecs Notice that some applications come packaged with proprietary codecs; that is the case for VLC for instance. If you install these applications from the official repositories you don't need to install codecs manually. Set up your GPU driver \u2693\ufe0e Check out the following documentation for this step: single GPUs integrated + dedicated GPUs Use a password manager \u2693\ufe0e KDE's kwallet and gnome-keyring are decent password managers as far as storing identifiers meant to be consumed by third-party applications, but some users might feel they fall short when it comes at providing a comfortable interface for auto-completion and daily management (especially the latter). For alternatives you can consider KeePass Password Safe and Password Safe . Have your backup plan ready \u2693\ufe0e Tumbleweed snapshots protect your system by allowing you to rollback to and from the snapshot of your liking. One noticeable exceptions to this protection is /home (for the simple reason that it allows the user to backup their home at their own pace, independently from system snapshots.) To protect your users' /home directory you may want to use a third-party application to manage user-defined backups. We can recommend restic and the easier to the new user rclone .

Most users are used to Live images, packing a full-blown environment where they can test out a Linux distribution before installing. Note Users interested in Tumbleweed should bear in mind that, because of the way Tumbleweed is built, Tumbleweed Live images are missing a handful of tests in comparison to Tumbleweed DVD images (see below). So even if Live images can be considered reasonably safe for most users, we cannot guarantee the same quality assurance as for DVD images. Our live images (~950 MBs) provide the following desktop environments: KDE GNOME XFCE They each come in different flavours tailor-suited to your CPU architecture: x86_64 (64-bit) i686 (32-bit) aarch64 (Armv8-A \"ARM\" 64-bit) The two other installation media we provide are DVD images and Network installer. DVD images are quite bulky (~4.5 GBs), but allow you to install an entire distribution without relying on network for retrieving components. Networks installers are much lighter (~150 MBs); they require a stable and hopefully fast connection to fetch components over the network. Authenticity & integrity checks (*NIX) \u2693\ufe0e Note The following two steps are optional, but are considered good practice. You perform an integrity check when you want to make sure that a given file has not been tampered with. It typically involves making sure that a file's checksum matches a certain target. You perform an authenticity check when you want to make sure that a file -- typically the file that specifies the checksum target -- was obtained from a legitimate source (i.e. openSUSE). Because performing an integrity check against an inauthentic target does not make sense, you want to first do an authenticity check, and only then do an integrity check. Assumptions & definitions \u2693\ufe0e In what follows we make the following assumptions: You have downloaded an openSUSE Live, Network or DVD image from openSUSE website (hereafter: the Image ): Tumbleweed Leap You have obtained the Target Checksum file for your image, by clicking on the Checksum next to the image. You have obtained openSUSE gpg Public Key by importing it via its keyid into your gpg keyring with $ gpg --recv-keys 0x22C07BA534178CD02EFE22AAB88B2FD43DBDC284 You have obtained an openSUSE gpg Detached Signature file corresponding to the image you want to perform the check upon. The Tumbleweed detached signature files are held within a single directory here . Regarding Leap however you need to start there and use the /live subdirectory for the live images and the rescue images (the /iso subdirectory does not provide any detached signature for net installers and DVD images). Once you have the address of the signature file, the command looks like this (i.e. for KDE Live): $ wget http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-KDE-Live-x86_64-Current.iso.sha256.asc Authenticity check \u2693\ufe0e For Tumbleweed (all images) and Leap (only live images) the authenticity check is an instance of the command: $ gpg --verify <Detached Signature.asc> <Target Checksum.iso.sha256> For Leap non-live images (typically DVD images) the authenticity check uses no signature (clearsign check); it is an instance of the command: $ gpg --verify <Target Checksum.iso.sha256> The check passes just in case the command outputs calls it a success. Warning If the check fails, make sure you are honoring our assumptions . Integrity check \u2693\ufe0e It is an instance of the command: $ sha256sum <Image.iso> The check passes just in case the output of the above equals the checksum written in plain text in the Target Checksum (see Definitions & assumptions ). Authenticity and integrity checks (Windows 10) \u2693\ufe0e Preparation : 1. Download the filename.iso.sha256 file from the Download section of opensuse.org or download the hash files from here for Tumbleweed: https://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-DVD-x86_64-Current.iso.sha256 for Leap: https://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.3/iso/openSUSE-Leap-15.3-DVD-x86_64-Current.iso.sha256 Note that it does not matter where exactly you put the files as long as they are all in the same folder and keep their original names. Then browse to https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html and download and install the Windows installer for GnuPG. Info For the purposes of this guide it does not matter whether you install the program as administrator or not, so just click yes to install, to install without administrator rights if it asks you. Find the folder containing the files you downloaded in the first step, hold Shift while right-clicking it (the folder, not the files in it). Select it to open a command window. Use whichever command line utility you've got available, but if you used the PowerShell option, type cmd followed by Enter in the command prompt. Integrity Check \u2693\ufe0e Locate the folder of the downloaded ISO image Open a command prompt. cd to the folder and finally type this command, confirming the command with Enter : CertUtil -hashfile <filename>.iso SHA256 # replace <filename> with the actual name of your ISO image Example: certutil -hashfile openSUSE-Tumbleweed-DVD-x86_64-Snapshot20210611-Media.iso SHA256 Note that if you start typing a filename you can press Tab to automatically complete it. This will take a little while to complete and eventually present you with an alphanumeric sequence that is called a hash. If this hash is identical to the one listed in your filename.iso.sha256 then the integrity check passed. You can compare them by hand (note that some Windows text editors will not display the line breaks in that document so it may look weirdly formatted) or better use the find command. If the same hash is not found in <file_name>.iso.sha256 , then your downloaded ISO image did not pass the integrity check. Make sure you downloaded the correct <file_name>.iso.sha256 and if yes, try to download the ISO image again from a different mirror server. Try on it the integrity again. Info On older versions of Windows, the CertUtil command does not exist. Instead it is recommended to install 7zip from https://www.7-zip.org/, then find and right-click the .iso file your downloaded in Windows Explorer and select 7-Zip's CRC SHA option to calculate the SHA 256 hash, which must then compare to the one from the filename.iso.sha256 file yourself. Warning Never install from an .iso that failed the integrity check. Authenticity Check \u2693\ufe0e To perform the authenticity check of the ISO image, obtain the official GPG public key and SHA256 hash file from here (http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/) of your required openSUSE iso version. Download the required \"filename.iso.sha256.asc\" and \"filename.iso.sha256\" file and save it named with \"sha256sum.txt.gpg\" and \"sha256sum.txt\" in one folder. (Note: ISO file and these two .txt file should be in one folder). You can then perform the check from a command prompt. gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt {Message for you Ad: you can attach a image of the result of this command line} As long as it says Good signature from \"openSUSE Tumbleweed ISO Signing Key root@opensuse.org \" and with a fingerprint matching the one shown above and that you used to download the key, then that means your download is authentic. In case it was tampered with the message would be BAD signature from .... You can ignore the warning that comes after that, it is expected and perfectly normal. Get to the installer \u2693\ufe0e In this section you will learn how to get to a running installer for Tumbleweed or Leap . This involves: Using a program to write an installation image -- see Choosing an installation image above -- to an external device, usually a USB pen drive or some other external storage medium. Having the media adequately partitioned to host the image, and making it bootable Booting on the external media and running the installer. We will assume that you have downloaded an installation image and optionally, have performed an authenticity check on it -- see the above sections for details. The next section also assumes that you will be using a USB flash drive as the installation media. The section after that handles external hard drives. Prepare the installation media (USB flash drive) \u2693\ufe0e The process for preparing the installation media varies depending on the operating system from which you are following these steps. Different operating systems offer different applications. We recommend using any of the following programs, which we have tested and which are known to be simple to use and reliable on their respective platforms: - Fedora Image Writer ( Windows & Mac , Linux flatpak ) For Fedora Image Writer : Make sure your USB flash drive has enough storage to hold the image (either ~1 GB or ~5 GB) and plug it in. Run Fedora Image Writer . From the main menu pick Custom image and then select the .iso image to write to the USB flash drive. Make sure that both the image and flash drive have been correctly selected, as in: Finally, click on Write to Disk . Once writing the image is done, you are ready to reboot from the USB drive. Leaving the USB drive plugged in, use the method appropriate to your operating system to restart your computer. Reboot to the device \u2693\ufe0e Assuming you have successfully installed an openSUSE distribution, you should reboot according to the method relevant to your current operating system. Windows \u2693\ufe0e Use these instructions to reboot to your BIOS or UEFI. From there you will be able to select the USB flash drive hosting the installation image as boot destination. macOS \u2693\ufe0e Simply hold the alt (option) key immediately after restarting and select the openSUSE bootloader from there.","title":"Preparing the installation media"},{"location":"image_choice/#choosing-an-installation-media","text":"The installers and images can be obtained on the Tumbleweed and Leap pages.

Info Those components are called packages , because they \"pack\" the programs and resources making up most of your system, along with tools to install them). \"Upgrading\" means \"Upgrading packages\" (such as those that constitute your Linux distribution). Even though Tumbleweed follows a rolling-release model, it is very stable: openSUSE thoroughly tests every package before release, ensuring the stability of your system. Moreover you can always revert back to the previous state of Tumbleweed (in jargon: \"switch to the previous snapshot\". Snapshots are explained here ). However, keep in mind that Tumbleweed requires a reliable internet connection and a healthy hard drive to work as designed. It also requires that you sometimes take interest in the updating process. Leap \u2693\ufe0e Leap is a more traditional distribution: it uses a fixed-points release model, just like Windows, Ubuntu, or macOS. Leap is a very battle-hardened operating system, mostly made up of packages brought over from SUSE Linux Enterprise, a commercial Linux operating system, and of packages from Tumbleweed after they were tested, tried and used by the community. It is worth noting that Leap provides a Linux kernel that is several years behind the version offered by Tumbleweed. Info The kernel is the heart of any Linux operating system. It translates your keystrokes and mouse clicks into the ones and zeros the computer understands, and is updated regularly so that the computer can respond to new hardware added to the system. This means that you might be better served by Tumbleweed if you have a recent computer or rely extensively on \"exotic\" hardware. Our recommendation \u2693\ufe0e Tumbleweed is a great choice for use as a daily driver and workstation. Unlike Leap it supports both 64- and 32-bit hardware and packs a fresh Linux kernel good at supporting recent machines -- notably laptops -- and peripherals. Nevertheless, Leap is to be preferred if you: have a very limited bandwidth or an unreliable access to the Internet; have an old (7+ years old) mechanical hard drive that will struggle with frequent, numerous updates; cannot afford to reboot your computer frequently to install updates; don't want to use, or switch between, different snapshots; rely on specific versions of important packages, including hardware drivers; would rather not do package management manually and, more generally, would rather avoid using the command line. If you are interested in Tumbleweed and want to know more about what typical use-cases and workflows look like, head over to this page . Desktop Environments \u2693\ufe0e Leap offers the GNOME and KDE Plasma desktop environments by default. Tumbleweed offers GNOME , KDE Plasma , and XFCE . These options are chosen during the System Role section of the installation. Additional options are available in the Software selection of the installer. These desktop environment patterns may also be viewed and modified with the YaST Software Management module. Modern desktop environments have evolved into highly consistent and productive computing experiences. Choosing the right desktop environment for you can be a deeply personal experience; many people feel as passionately about their desktop environment as they do their distribution. One of the distinguishing features of openSUSE, during the installation, is the ability to choose a desktop environment. This provides a certain level of assurance that you will have a well-supported desktop experience for that desktop environment, no derivatives or spin-offs needed. Installation \u2693\ufe0e During openSUSE Installation , there is a section titled System Role , which applies patterns to the software selected for the respective installation. This is the primary means to select a desktop environment. There is an additional option titled Generic Desktop . If you wish to install a desktop environment available in the installer, but not in the System Role , you can select Generic Desktop and customize the Software selection later within the installer. The descriptions below are as provided by the respective projects. GNOME \u2693\ufe0e GNOME 3 has been designed from the ground up to help you have the best possible computing experience. GNOME 3 provides a focused working environment that helps you to get things done, and it is packed with features that will make you more productive. A powerful search feature lets you access all your work from one place. Side-by-side windows makes it easy to view several documents at the same time, and we even provide a way to turn off notifications when you really need to concentrate on the task in hand. GNOME.org Install Gnome Installer > System Role : Select Desktop with GNOME KDE Plasma \u2693\ufe0e Plasma is made to stay out of the way as it helps you get things done. But under its light and intuitive surface, it's a powerhouse. So you're free to choose ways of usage right as you need them and when you need them. With Plasma the user is king. Not happy with the color scheme? Change it! Want to have your panel on the left edge of the screen? Move it! Don't like the font? Use a different one! Download custom widgets in one click and add them to your desktop or panel. KDE.org Install KDE Plasma Installer > System Role : Select Desktop with KDE Plasma XFCE \u2693\ufe0e XFCE is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly. XFCE embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. It consists of a number of components that provide the full functionality one can expect of a modern desktop environment. They are packaged separately and you can pick among the available packages to create the optimal personal working environment. Another priority of XFCE is adherence to standards, specifically those defined at freedesktop.org .

Generic Desktop \u2693\ufe0e Another option for a System Role is the Generic Desktop environment. This option enables IceWM , but also allows selection of one of the optional desktop environments later, during the Software selection of the installation. If you intend to choose one of the other desktop environments, choose Yes , when asked \"Activate online repositories now?\" and ensure Main Repository (OSS) is enabled on the Online Repositories step. IceWM \u2693\ufe0e IceWM is a window manager for the X Window System. The goal of IceWM is speed, simplicity, and not getting in the user\u2019s way. It comes with a taskbar with pager, global and per-window keybindings and a dynamic menu system. Application windows can be managed by the keyboard and mouse. Windows can be iconified to the taskbar, to the tray, to the desktop or be hidden. They are controllable by a quick switch window (Alt+Tab) and in a window list. Ice-WM.org Install IceWM Installer > System Role : Select Generic Desktop Additional Choices \u2693\ufe0e Before confirming the installation, an overview is provided with the selected installation options, titled Installer Settings . At this point, you can modify the Software selected to be installed. In addition to reducing or adding packages, you can also select other desktop environments to install. If you prefer one of these desktop environments, de-select the A very basic desktop pattern, then select one of the below patterns: Enlightenment \u2693\ufe0e Enlightenment is classified as a \"desktop shell\" as it provides everything you need to operate your desktop or laptop, but it is not a full application suite. This covers functionality including launching applications, managing their windows and performing system tasks like suspending, rebooting, managing files and so on.

LXDE \u2693\ufe0e LXDE, which stands for Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment, is a desktop environment which is lightweight and fast. It is designed to be user friendly and slim, while keeping the resource usage low. LXDE uses less RAM and less CPU while being a feature rich desktop environment. Unlike other tightly integrated desktops LXDE strives to be modular, so each component can be used independently with few dependencies. This makes porting LXDE to different distributions and platforms easier.

LXQt \u2693\ufe0e LXQt is a Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment. It will not get in your way. It will not hang or slow down your system. It is focused on being a classic desktop with a modern look and feel. Historically, LXQt is the product of the merge between LXDE-Qt, an initial Qt flavour of LXDE, and Razor-qt, a project aiming to develop a Qt based desktop environment with similar objectives as the current LXQt.

To check whether they are enabled, open your desktop environment's settings and search for power management . In contrast, hibernation may need to be set up manually. Suspend-to-disk (hibernation) \u2693\ufe0e When it is running, your computer keeps all running programs and current state in memory (RAM). Suspend-to-RAM is a way to save energy by powering off most components of a computer, except its memory, meaning state is kept. This is a quick way to enable a low-power mode but has an important drawback: It still requires a some power. If you put your laptop to sleep for long that its battery runs out of power, the laptop will turn off. This means you will lose any unsaved work and can also result in disk corruption. A secondary issue is that some events can wake the machine from sleep, and there is a risk of it overheating in a confined space. This includes connection and disconnection of USB devices or accidentally pressing external buttons or switches. Suspend-to-disk (hibernation) is different: The contents of the machine's memory are saved to disk, then the machine turns off completely. In this state it uses no power and will resume back to where you were an arbitrary length of time later. When Linux hibernates, it saves the contents of the memory to the swap partition. On the next boot, the kernel checks the swap partition and if it finds a suspend image there, it reads it back into memory and resumes operation. This has important consequences: Your machine must have a dedicated swap partition . If you use multiple Linux distributions side-by-side that share a swap partition, hibernation will have unpredictable results and will not work reliably. If you dual-boot with Windows, there can also be problems. Two potential issues are: If you use Windows' partition(s) under both OSes and hibernate Linux, boot Windows, and then resume Linux, this will result in disk corruption. This happens because the contents of the partitions will have changed while Linux was in hibernation. For related reasons, we recommend that you disable hibernation and \"Fast Boot\" in Windows. \"Fast Boot\" can cause issues if you mount any Windows partitions via /etc/fstab . To disable both settings, open command prompt in Administrator Mode and enter: powercfg -h off Then close the admin prompt and reboot. Hibernation should but might not work if you use a swap file in your root partition instead of a separate swap partition. Hibernation will not work if you use the ZRAM tool to swap into compressed RAM disks. Requirements for hibernation \u2693\ufe0e If you do have a dedicated partition, the following requirements must be met: Swap exists : A swap partition on the disk must exist (see below for details) Swap is big enough : the swap partition must be at least as big as the total amount of RAM fitted to the computer, and preferably slightly more. There must be enough space in the partition to hold the entire contents of your computer's memory. If your computer is short on RAM and so Linux normally uses swap space when running, then you need additional space for the memory image in addition to how much which is normally used. Historically, when RAM was expensive and systems typically used swap heavily, users often allocated at least twice as much space for swap as there was RAM. On modern computers with large amounts of RAM this usually is a waste of disk space. We recommend the size of RAM + 1 GB. Swap is referenced : The swap space must be specified in /etc/fstab . This file specifies the various partitions to be mounted into the Linux file system and is read every time Linux boots. Resume is referenced : The partition to which system will hibernate must be made known to the kernel, usually as the value of a kernel parameter Creating a swap partition \u2693\ufe0e A swap partition can be created while partitioning your disks during installation, or in a separate step after installation. During installation \u2693\ufe0e This is adapted from the installation documentation and repeated here for convenience. Step by step: Expert partitioning From the Disk view, select Expert Partitioner Click Add Partition (bottom left-hand side) Add a swap partition with a size equal to your current RAM + 1 GB. After installation \u2693\ufe0e From YaST : You need a dedicated disk partition for swap. It does not matter where on the disk it is, so after your existing partitions is often convenient. If you have an existing partition you plan to use, you can skip the following two sections on partition creation. If the partition does not exist yet \u2693\ufe0e If your disk is partitioned with the GPT scheme, you can add another partition at the end. If it is partitioned with MBR, the old DOS partitioning scheme applies: You can only have a maximum of four primary partitions, so you may want to make the new swap partition a logical partition inside the extended partition. If an extended partition does not already exist, create one. If you already have four primary partitions, you must remove one, or back up its contents to an external drive, remove it, create an extended partition and then copy its contents back into a new logical partition inside the extended partition. Logical partitions are numbered starting at /dev/sda5 , even if you only have 1 or 2 primary partitions. Creating a new swap partition \u2693\ufe0e Boot from a Linux Live USB, such as the openSUSE Live CD Run the GParted dynamic-partitioning tool. Choose a partition from which you can spare some capacity. Shrink your desired partition by the amount of space you wish to give to swap. Create a new partition in the now-free space. Pick a type of Linux swap . Reboot the computer and remove the bootable USB medium or optical disk. If the partition already exists \u2693\ufe0e Open the Partitioner module. Select Disks from the list on your left-hand side, and take note of the identifier of the partition you will want to resume to. Note both the UUID and the /dev/sda<number> identifiers. Click Create partition . Add a swap partition with a size equal to your current RAM + 1 GB. Make sure it is formatted as swap . Confirm to apply the changes. Testing your new swap partition \u2693\ufe0e Whichever method was used, by now YaST should have edited your /etc/fstab file to reference the freshly created swap partition, which means that conditions 1 and 3 (swap exists and is referenced) above should be met. You can check that this is the case with the command: $ blkid | grep \"swap\" This command should return a line referencing various identifiers for your swap partition. You can compare the UUID visible from this context with the UUID listed in YaST for good measure (see step 2 above). If you created the swap partition during installation, search for the UUID and the /dev/sda<number> identifiers referencing the partition your computer will resume to. If you have rebooted your computer after creating the partition, you can check to see if your new swap partition is active with the following command: sudo swapon -s If you have not yet rebooted and you wish to activate and start swapping onto the partition immediately, use the following command with the device name of your new partition: sudo swapon /dev/sda<number> Finally, make sure that the resume partition is referenced via YaST : Open the Bootloader module. Switch to the Kernel Parameters tab. In the text field Optional Kernel Parameters , add the resume parameter and a reference to UUID of the partition you want to resume from: resume=UUID=<UUID> # replace '<UUID>' with the UUID Alternatively, you can use the partition number (not recommended) : resume=/dev/sda<number> # replace '<number>' with the partition number Important We recommend using UUIDs ( Universal Unique Identifier ) instead of other identifiers for referencing partitions. UUIDs are unambiguous and do not change when other partitions are added or removed. However, UUIDs will change if you reformat or delete and recreate a swap partition. In such cases, update the UUID where appropriate. For resume partitions, update the resume kernel parameter: resume=UUID=19bd024f-76bd-4162-ac37-4d0d51e02c25 For swap space, update /etc/fstab : UUID=e0bac415-cbde-4c9b-8178-7874ac9de70a none swap defaults 0 0 When you are happy that the partition is in place and works, try the hibernate command of your desktop. This is often located next to the shut down, reboot and sleep commands. More information \u2693\ufe0e You can read about testing and using hibernation functionality in the openSUSE Wiki: SDB:Suspend to disk .","title":"Power management"},{"location":"power/#power-saving-methods","text":"On modern hardware, Linux desktop environments generally use some combination of the following methods for saving power, often in this order: Dimming the monitor(s) Suspending the monitor(s) Suspending the system into RAM (also called suspend-to-RAM , sleep or suspend mode ) Suspending the system to disk (also called suspend-to-disk , hibernation or deep sleep ) Monitor dimming , monitor suspension , and suspend-to-RAM are usually enabled by default. To check whether they are enabled, open your desktop environment's settings and search for power management . In contrast, hibernation may need to be set up manually.","title":"Power-saving methods"},{"location":"power/#suspend-to-disk-hibernation","text":"When it is running, your computer keeps all running programs and current state in memory (RAM). Suspend-to-RAM is a way to save energy by powering off most components of a computer, except its memory, meaning state is kept. This is a quick way to enable a low-power mode but has an important drawback: It still requires a some power. If you put your laptop to sleep for long that its battery runs out of power, the laptop will turn off. This means you will lose any unsaved work and can also result in disk corruption. A secondary issue is that some events can wake the machine from sleep, and there is a risk of it overheating in a confined space. This includes connection and disconnection of USB devices or accidentally pressing external buttons or switches. Suspend-to-disk (hibernation) is different: The contents of the machine's memory are saved to disk, then the machine turns off completely. In this state it uses no power and will resume back to where you were an arbitrary length of time later. When Linux hibernates, it saves the contents of the memory to the swap partition. On the next boot, the kernel checks the swap partition and if it finds a suspend image there, it reads it back into memory and resumes operation. This has important consequences: Your machine must have a dedicated swap partition . If you use multiple Linux distributions side-by-side that share a swap partition, hibernation will have unpredictable results and will not work reliably. If you dual-boot with Windows, there can also be problems. Two potential issues are: If you use Windows' partition(s) under both OSes and hibernate Linux, boot Windows, and then resume Linux, this will result in disk corruption. This happens because the contents of the partitions will have changed while Linux was in hibernation. For related reasons, we recommend that you disable hibernation and \"Fast Boot\" in Windows. \"Fast Boot\" can cause issues if you mount any Windows partitions via /etc/fstab . To disable both settings, open command prompt in Administrator Mode and enter: powercfg -h off Then close the admin prompt and reboot. Hibernation should but might not work if you use a swap file in your root partition instead of a separate swap partition. Hibernation will not work if you use the ZRAM tool to swap into compressed RAM disks.","title":"Suspend-to-disk (hibernation)"},{"location":"power/#requirements-for-hibernation","text":"If you do have a dedicated partition, the following requirements must be met: Swap exists : A swap partition on the disk must exist (see below for details) Swap is big enough : the swap partition must be at least as big as the total amount of RAM fitted to the computer, and preferably slightly more. There must be enough space in the partition to hold the entire contents of your computer's memory. If your computer is short on RAM and so Linux normally uses swap space when running, then you need additional space for the memory image in addition to how much which is normally used. Historically, when RAM was expensive and systems typically used swap heavily, users often allocated at least twice as much space for swap as there was RAM. On modern computers with large amounts of RAM this usually is a waste of disk space. We recommend the size of RAM + 1 GB. Swap is referenced : The swap space must be specified in /etc/fstab .

If you're still unable to find a matching driver, you can use the Find more button just to the left of \"Driver Packages.\" That will bring up a list of very generic printer definition files. Selecting one that seems to broadly describe your printer may allow you to perform basic prints, even if you may not be using your printer's most advanced capabilities. When you have selected a satisfactory driver, choose the default paper size you load into your printer, set or revise the name that the printer will go by in print dialogs, and hit OK.

Note that each connection is assigned to a \"zone\" -- basically a named collection of firewall policies. If this is your first time using firewall-config, all connections are assigned to the \"public\" zone. You should not modify the public zone; that should remain your most secure zone for using an unfamiliar or untrusted internet connection. Instead, you should take your known, trusted connections and assign them to a different zone. For example, you might take a connection to your home Wi-Fi and assign that to the (likely pre-existing) zone called \"home.\" (You can do this by clicking on the connection in the list and then the Change Zone button.) You can authorize more services in the \"home\" zone, so that when your computer connects in a new way (such as the coffee-shop Wi-Fi), that new connection will be assigned to the default, highly secure, \"public\" zone. To get printing working in \"home\", select it from the list of zones in the \"Configuration\" panel, and select the \"Services\" tab to its right.

Finding where you fit and moving from there \u2693\ufe0e Linux distributions try to strike a balance between the time and effort expected from two groups: maintainers and developers, whose main goal is to produce the operating system(s) of the distribution with reproducible and streamlined processes; end-users, whose main goal is to keep their running installation productive and healthy without too much hassle. Moreover individuals have different priorities, preferences and degrees of curiosity. For Tumbleweed this means different possible answers to the question: \"How should I maintain my running system productive and healthy?\". On one end there might be users who want to make the least possible effort to keep their system productive and healthy, or are not deeply interested in learning how it works. On the other end there might be users willing to sacrifice a lot of time and effort for tinkering and learning -- and hopefully in the long run, contributing to openSUSE . The lazy way \u2693\ufe0e This is a workflow where the user minimizes the need for manual interventions on their running installation. The way is fine for most users who: don't want to spend time configuring their system; or don't want to take any risk associated with maintenance routines. Here are some rules of thumb for following this approach: User application When installing user applications, favour containerized versions (ideally flatpaks , see here ). Use software from the official repositories only when no containerized version is available. System dependencies Do not manually install important system libraries or codecs directly from zypper or YaST2 . Instead prefer flatpaks or at least software that ship with their own static libraries and codecs (certain web browsers do). When you don't have the choice you can use .rpm from the official repositories but in this case, install them from opi to simplify maintenance. Update pace and method When updating, aim for least every other week or about twice a month. More or less frequently might create issues. Use sudo zypper dup , plus if that applies to you, flatpak update (see this systemd unit for automatic daily flatpak updates). Never update with gnome-software (GNOME) or discover (KDE Plasma), as they create unnecessary risks for your system. Beware of patterns openSUSE applies the notion of a pattern -- a distinguished collection of packages related to the same theme. You can view all the patterns (and the packages that constitute them) with: zypper search -t pattern The ones indicated with i or i+ are installed on your system. In a way patterns exist over and above packages, which means they can be tricky to work with. For example, because of how patterns interact with the --recommends flag, zypper tends to reinstall packages you have (consciously) removed in the past, should they belong to a pattern which in itself is not removed yet. To counteract this interaction it might be helpful to update with the --no-recommends flag, as in: sudo zypper dup --no-recommends Generally it is safe to omit this flag when installing specific packages with zypper in . As for removing an entire pattern, it is possible with the command: zypper rm -u <name of the pattern> This functionality is also offered by YaST , which might be easier to use for removing patterns. Crucially fresh software with a set workflow If you need fresh updates for essential parts of your toolchain (typically when working with a programming language stack), always favour the language's official, remote installer. Kernels If you don't need to always be running the latest kernel (and that's likely your case), use the multiversion zypp setting described here . Start lazy, get busy! \u2693\ufe0e We encourage users to deviate -- little by little, as they build skills and self-confidence -- from the \"lazy way\" described above. Doing so means that users will be more often using packages from the official repositories and get familiar with the typical openSUSE tools (such as Zypper , Snapper and YaST ) and configuration scenarios. In the long run this will strengthen their understanding of Linux and of the openSUSE distributions, while improving their ability to troubleshoot with autonomy. At scale the openSUSE Project benefits more from users in position to report bugs, provide feedback and make direct contributions. openSUSE MicroOS as desktop workstation \u2693\ufe0e Although it is not recommended for new users, it is possible to use MicroOS on a desktop computer, taking advantage of transactional updates. Consider our guide to get started . MicroOS might appeal to advanced users familiar with the command line and willing to configure the system in a fine-grained manner. The tradeoff of this extra bit of learning at start means that users get a tailor-fit system requiring little to no maintenance. This latter advantage makes the system especially suited for friends and relatives with little to no experience of Linux or openSUSE, provided the configuration is done by someone knowledgeable. The reader might also be interested in the MicroOS documentation for the official documentation about this use case.","title":"Safety and usability on Tumbleweed"},{"location":"safety_usability/#safety-and-usability-on-tumbleweed","text":"There are two \"don't-s\" to keep in mind when using Tumbleweed: don't use the \"1-click installers\" available from https://software.opensuse.org don't install from Open Build Service home: repositories Apart from that finding the sweet spot between safety and usability mostly depends on your preferences and your use-case.","title":"Safety and usability on Tumbleweed"},{"location":"safety_usability/#finding-where-you-fit-and-moving-from-there","text":"Linux distributions try to strike a balance between the time and effort expected from two groups: maintainers and developers, whose main goal is to produce the operating system(s) of the distribution with reproducible and streamlined processes; end-users, whose main goal is to keep their running installation productive and healthy without too much hassle.

Update pace and method When updating, aim for least every other week or about twice a month. More or less frequently might create issues. Use sudo zypper dup , plus if that applies to you, flatpak update (see this systemd unit for automatic daily flatpak updates). Never update with gnome-software (GNOME) or discover (KDE Plasma), as they create unnecessary risks for your system. Beware of patterns openSUSE applies the notion of a pattern -- a distinguished collection of packages related to the same theme. You can view all the patterns (and the packages that constitute them) with: zypper search -t pattern The ones indicated with i or i+ are installed on your system. In a way patterns exist over and above packages, which means they can be tricky to work with. For example, because of how patterns interact with the --recommends flag, zypper tends to reinstall packages you have (consciously) removed in the past, should they belong to a pattern which in itself is not removed yet. To counteract this interaction it might be helpful to update with the --no-recommends flag, as in: sudo zypper dup --no-recommends Generally it is safe to omit this flag when installing specific packages with zypper in . As for removing an entire pattern, it is possible with the command: zypper rm -u <name of the pattern> This functionality is also offered by YaST , which might be easier to use for removing patterns. Crucially fresh software with a set workflow If you need fresh updates for essential parts of your toolchain (typically when working with a programming language stack), always favour the language's official, remote installer. Kernels If you don't need to always be running the latest kernel (and that's likely your case), use the multiversion zypp setting described here .","title":"The lazy way"},{"location":"safety_usability/#start-lazy-get-busy","text":"We encourage users to deviate -- little by little, as they build skills and self-confidence -- from the \"lazy way\" described above.

Snapshots are fully defined state in your system at one point in time, just like a photography is a fully defined moment in a movie, for example. Snapper is able to create, delete and compare snapshots, and to undo changes that occurred between snapshots. It is thus a powerful maintenance tool that allows you to 'cheat' the flow of time: if you run into an outstanding bug you can use Snapper to rollback to a past snapshot, typically one where the bug didn't exist yet. Or if you've already moved to a past snapshot, you are able to switch move to a snapshot that lies in the 'future' relative to it. Snapper has both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical Interface . Not all functionality is available through the graphical interface but inexperienced users should find it sufficient for basic tasks. Snapper is deeply integrated with the Btrfs filesystem, serving as an easy to use helper for the built in functions of Btrfs. The most common Btrfs tasks can be conducted with Snapper, however, there may be instances when it is necessary to interact with Btrfs directly. Tumbleweed users should note that understanding how to use Snapper is an important step in maintaining a stable, functional system. As a rolling release, Tumbleweed, is subjected to less testing overall and the occasional system breaking update can be installed. Such problems are quickly and easily resolved with Snapper. Info Even though Snapper is key to a healthy Tumbleweed experience, it also benefits Leap as it allows you to quickly recover from breakages occurring before login, typically involving the GRUB bootloader or the loading of the kernel with unhealthy parameter values. Snapper capabilities \u2693\ufe0e Undo system changes made by zypper and YaST. Restore files from previous snapshots. Do a system rollback by booting from a snapshot. Manually create and manage snapshots, within the running system. Defaults \u2693\ufe0e By default, openSUSE Tumbleweed formats your hard drive with the Btrfs filesystem which provides the powerful snapshot capabilities. Snapshots are automatically enabled for the root partition / . The default snapshot configuration should only be changed by experienced users but it is important to note some default behaviour for new users as well. Snapshots are automatically enabled for the root / partition if it is larger than 16 Gigabytes. This is to ensure there is enough disk space for the snapshots and important system tasks to occur, which may include moving, writing or deleting files. If the root / partition is smaller than 16 Gigabytes a different kind of snapshot is used, known as \"Timeline Snapshots\". These snapshots are created every hour. By default only the first snapshot of the last ten days, months, and years are kept. This ensures there are some snapshots for system rollbacks while taking up very minimal disk space. The users /home directory is not included in snapshots and should not be relied on as a data backup for personal files. This prevents data loss if a system rollback is conducted. Changes to personal files would also be \"undone\". Directories /opt and /usr/local , where various software and third-party products are installed are not included in snapshots by default. This prevents uninstalling the software if a system rollback is conducted. Snapshot Types \u2693\ufe0e snapper features 3 types of snapshots: Timeline , Installation , and Administration . Timeline snapshots are single snapshots, created every hour and old snapshots are automatically deleted. By default, the first snapshot of the last ten days, months, and years are kept. Disabled by default on partitions larger than 16 Gigabytes. The only single snapshots present may be the ones created when openSUSE was installed. Installation snapshots are created in pairs ( Pre and Post ) when packages are installed with YaST or Zypper. Snapshot pairs are marked as important if an important system component, such as the kernel, has been installed. Enabled by default. Administration snapshots are created in pairs ( Pre and Post ) when system administration is performed using YaST. The Pre snapshot is created when a YaST module is started and the Post snapshot is created when the module is closed. Enabled by default. Note By default, the last ten important and the last ten regular snapshot pairs are kept. This total encompasses both Installation and Administration snapshot types. Snapshots are automatically deleted when they take up too much space on the disk, but four important and two regular snapshots are always kept. Configuring Snapper \u2693\ufe0e By default Snapper is configured for access with sudo privileges (typically root ). This is because under the hood Snapper works hand-in-hand with the Btrfs file system, which is set up for root . Thus in this section we will assume that you will use Snapper accordingly. To get started you can display all current configurations: $ sudo snapper list-configs That would typically return: Configuration | Subvolume --------------+------------ root | / To show this configuration, which is by default the current user's configuration: $ sudo snapper -c root get-config returning for example: -----------------------+------- ALLOW_GROUPS | ALLOW_USERS | BACKGROUND_COMPARISON | yes EMPTY_PRE_POST_CLEANUP | yes EMPTY_PRE_POST_MIN_AGE | 1800 FREE_LIMIT | 0.2 FSTYPE | btrfs NUMBER_CLEANUP | yes NUMBER_LIMIT | 4 NUMBER_LIMIT_HOURLY | 3 NUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT | 2 NUMBER_MIN_AGE | 1800 QGROUP | 1/0 SPACE_LIMIT | 0.2 SUBVOLUME | / SYNC_ACL | no TIMELINE_CLEANUP | yes TIMELINE_CREATE | no TIMELINE_LIMIT_DAILY | 10 TIMELINE_LIMIT_HOURLY | 10 TIMELINE_LIMIT_MONTHLY | 10 TIMELINE_LIMIT_WEEKLY | 0 TIMELINE_LIMIT_YEARLY | 10 TIMELINE_MIN_AGE | 1800 Notice the snapshot types discussed in the previous section, but don't take this for reference (you will want superior values for the NUMBER_LIMITS options). To change a value, do $ sudo snapper -c root set-config \"{option name}={new value}\" as in: $ sudo snapper -c root set-config \"NUMBER_LIMIT=4\" You can create configuration profiles for various purposes. To create a new profile, do $ sudo snapper -c <subvolume> create-config <subvolume id> as in: $ sudo snapper -c foo create-config /foo You can later remove any config with: $ sudo snapper -c <subvolume> delete-config <subvolume id> as in: $ sudo snapper -c foo delete-config /foot Creating and Deleting Snapshots \u2693\ufe0e You can create snapshots at any time. For example, to create a new snapshot for root (the default consumer of snapshots on openSUSE distributions): $ sudo snapper -c root create -d \"<description>\" or more tersely: $ sudo snapper create -d \"<description>\" Info Notice the \" \" surrounding the placeholder. It's a good practice to wrap text strings in this way, so as to make it easier to discern them from other types of values. It's advisable to use a meaningful description to make it easier to recognize your manually created snapshots later. To remove a snapshot, regardless of whether it was automatically or manually created, do: $ sudo snapper -c / delete <snapshot id> or the terser $ sudo snapper delete <snapshot id> Rolling back \u2693\ufe0e Identifying Snapshots \u2693\ufe0e There are two ways to identify which snapshot you may want to rollback to: * with the snapper command line utility * with the YaST utility at YaST > Filesystem Snapshots Snapper command line: $ sudo snapper list Snapper CLI Example $ sudo snapper list [sudo] password for root: # | Type | Pre # | Date | User | Cleanup | Description | UserData ----+--------+-------+---------------------------------+------+---------+-----------------------+-------------- 0 | single | | | root | | current | 1* | single | | Thu 17 Dec 2020 10:59:10 PM MST | root | | first root filesystem | 2 | single | | Fri 18 Dec 2020 12:02:05 AM MST | root | number | after installation | important=yes 39 | pre | | Sat 19 Dec 2020 01:58:34 PM MST | root | number | zypp(zypper) | important=no 40 | post | 39 | Sat 19 Dec 2020 01:58:54 PM MST | root | number | | important=no 41 | pre | | Sat 19 Dec 2020 01:59:02 PM MST | root | number | zypp(zypper) | important=no 42 | post | 41 | Sat 19 Dec 2020 01:59:59 PM MST | root | number | | important=no 43 | pre | | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:30:27 PM MST | root | number | yast firewall | 44 | pre | | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:31:17 PM MST | root | number | yast firewall | 45 | post | 43 | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:31:17 PM MST | root | number | | 46 | post | 44 | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:31:38 PM MST | root | number | | 47 | pre | | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:36:25 PM MST | root | number | zypp(zypper) | important=no 48 | post | 47 | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:37:00 PM MST | root | number | | important=no 49 | pre | | Tue 22 Dec 2020 07:40:20 PM MST | root | number | yast snapper | 50 | pre | | Tue 22 Dec 2020 07:42:33 PM MST | root | number | zypp(zypper) | important=yes 51 | post | 50 | Tue 22 Dec 2020 07:46:28 PM MST | root | number | | important=yes Snapper YaST interface example Note As snapshots are viewed, snapper will create more snapshots, because administrative tasks are being performed. Moving forward with the assumption there was an issue with the last zypper update, #47 is chosen as the snapshot to recover. Initiating a rollback \u2693\ufe0e Upon identification of a recovery snapshot, reboot openSUSE. At the boot menu, scroll down to, and select, Start bootloader from a read-only snapshot . On the Read-only Snapshot menu, scroll down to, and select, the desired recovery snapshot. Snapshot #47 is used here as an example. openSUSE will appear to boot as normal. Tip There isn't a scroll indicator on the Read-only Snapshot Menu, but it is possible to scroll down to select more options, if available. Confirming a rollback \u2693\ufe0e Once your system has booted, make sure you're satisfied with the current state of your system. Run some tests. Make sure any outstanding bug is not or no longer present. Then if you're satisfied, perform the rollback: $ sudo snapper rollback Your system should then be rebooted and the recovered snapshot will be the new default boot option. In rare cases rolling back with fail as snapper is not able to find the default sub-volume (this may happen if snapper's configuration and the state of your system have diverged in a problematic way, in most cases caused by user error). To perform a rollback nonetheless you can use the following command: $ sudo snapper --ambit classic rollback <id> replacing <id> with the id of the snapshot you wish to roll back to. Disk Space Management \u2693\ufe0e Snapshots don't occupy much space but certain configurations might still want to remove uneeded snapshots to preventing running out of disk space. Start with a simple list: $ sudo snapper list The list features a column mentioning an estimate of the space occupied by each snapshot. You can remove unneeded snapshots with $ sudo snapper delete <snapshot id> You will find the value of <snapshot id> in the first column ('#'). Subvolumes Health Check \u2693\ufe0e For illustration here is a healthy structure of subvolumes obtained with $ sudo btrfs subvolume list -p / ID 256 gen 70064 parent 5 top level 5 path @ ID 257 gen 198577 parent 256 top level 256 path @/var ID 258 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/usr/local ID 259 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/srv ID 260 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/root ID 261 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/opt ID 262 gen 198577 parent 256 top level 256 path @/home ID 263 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi ID 264 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/boot/grub2/i386-pc ID 265 gen 198573 parent 256 top level 256 path @/.snapshots ID 1034 gen 198573 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/224/snapshot ID 1141 gen 195869 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/325/snapshot ID 1142 gen 195876 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/326/snapshot ID 1143 gen 196235 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/327/snapshot ID 1144 gen 196320 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/328/snapshot Notice how all snapshots are immediately nested under @/.snapshots/<snapshot id> . If your structure does not match this, you should probably sanitize it. Generally unhealthy structures have the shape: @/.snapshots/<snapshot id>/<garbage> where <garbage> is anything else than just snapshot . If you happen to be in this situation consider removing all badly nested snapshots with: $ sudo btrfs subvolume delete -i <snapshot id> <path> as in for example: sudo btrfs subvolume delete -i 1031 /.snapshots/171/snapshot/.snapshots/420/snapshot/.snapshots/1/snapshot . You might also want to make sure the /.snapshots entry point is correctly registered against fstab : $ cat /etc/fstab UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /.snapshots btrfs subvol=/@/.snapshots 0 0 If this is not the case edit the fstab file accordingly: $ sudo nano /etc/fstab pasting on a new line UUID={your UUID} /.snapshots btrfs subvol=/@/.snapshots 0 0 where the value of your UUID can be determined simply by copying from neighbour lines in the file. Look in particular for lines meeting in the pattern: UID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /var btrfs subvol=/@/var 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /usr/local btrfs subvol=/@/usr/local 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /srv btrfs subvol=/@/srv 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /root btrfs subvol=/@/root 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /opt btrfs subvol=/@/opt 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /home btrfs subvol=/@/home 0 0 Further reading \u2693\ufe0e Snapper.io openSUSE Wiki Portal:Snapper","title":"Snapper and Btrfs"},{"location":"snapper/#snapper","text":"Snapper is a tool for filesystem snapshot management.

It gets updates on a continuous basis, usually several times a week. However, to bring some order and make it easier to manage producing and consuming updates, Tumbleweed fetches updates in batches. A single batch of updates is called a snapshot . Info Tumbleweed snapshots ought not to be confused with Btrfs snapshots , a completely different kind of snapshots. The latter make up the different filesystem states that allow Btrfs users, using tools like YaST2 and snapper , to control which state they want to actualize. Tumbleweed snapshots are thus batches of updates which are tested in openQA -- openSUSE's very best testing pipeline. The tests are thorough and check not only that each upgraded package is healthy, but also that all updates in the same snapshot play nice with one another. A snapshot is thus as healthy as the individual updates it holds, and as the compatibility between one another. It should be emphasized that by default, Tumbleweed updates across all available updates, whether or not they belong to the same snapshots. From the user's point of view, snapshots succeed to one another seamlessly and are not supposed to disturb the user's workflow. Updating/upgrading \u2693\ufe0e Unlike other Linux distributions, such as Leap, on Tumbleweed there is no distinction between updating (on other distributions: applying updates to packages) and upgrading (on other distributions: bringing the entire operating system to its latest possible state). You update/upgrade your system with: sudo zypper dup What this command does is to check whether all repositories registered against the system provide packages with available updates, collect and return the results. Upon confirmation from the user ( y in a terminal window) it will download and then install them. Info On Tumbleweed you will never have to use zypper-up , which is how you would update packages on Leap. The reason is that since Tumbleweed is a rolling-release distribution, updating it means not just updating an arbitrary collection of packages; it also means using the updated packages as the new snapshot which Tumbleweed is to realize. In addition to this zypper-dup enjoys some extra power over zypper-up , being able to not only edit packages, but to remove them when they are no longer required. It may occur that some repositories, when registered against the system, have not been configured to automatically look for new available updates during a zypper-dup . For this reason it might be useful to accompany this command with another one forcing all repositories to check for new updates, resulting in the pair: sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper dup That said, you can ensure that all repositories have been properly configured by listing them and, where applicable, by enabling their autorefresh feature. From the list of repositories obtained from: zypper lr identify repositories whose autorefresh value you want to tweak. For example: # | Alias | Name | Enab-> | GPG Check | Refresh ---+----------------------------------+---------------------+--------+-------------+------------- 2 | brave-browser-beta | brave-browser-beta | Yes | (r ) Yes | No shows that our brave-browser-beta repository has its refresh feature disabled. We can now set it to enabled with: sudo zypper mr -f 2 which is a compact instance of sudo zypper modifyrepo --refresh <repo identifier> Rolling back \u2693\ufe0e On Tumbleweed rolling back means changing the on-disk state of your system to a previous iteration. This is documented in details there . In a nutshell: Reboot your system. From the GRUB2 screen (bootloader), select Start Bootloader from a read-only snapshot . Select the snapshot you want to boot to. Log in normally and do sudo snapper rollback . Reverting to a previous kernel image \u2693\ufe0e As it happens, the Linux kernel sometimes undergoes regressions. For the end user this often translates into issues where the system has trouble communicating with the hardware. The user could rollback to a previous Btrfs snapshot (see previous section), but this would move the entire system -- not just the kernel -- to a previous state. However there are situations where only the kernel is the culprit. When that is the case you are often better off reverting to an older kernel instead of clinging on an old Tumbleweed snapshot through a snapper rollback. Here we will look at two likely scenarios: You want to revert to a recent kernel version shortly after noticing issues with the latest kernel. You want to revert to a not-so-recent kernel version because you weren't able to identify issues before it was removed from the official Tumbleweed repository. For either scenario to work, you will need to configure your system to accept using an older kernel and to expose GRUB2 entries enabling you to use it persistently. So if you find yourself in the (1) or in the (2) scenario, please follow along: Open zypper configuration file: $ sudo nano /etc/zypp/zypp.conf Make sure that the line multiversion = provides:multiversion(kernel) is not commented out (make sure there is no # prepended to multiversion = provides:multiversion(kernel) ). If the line is commented out, use the arrow keys to bring the cursor near the # and delete it. Then look at the line reading multiversion.kernels = <version> . It encodes the policy the system uses for keeping kernels. By default, what fills the <...> is latest,latest-1,running . This means that zypper should not remove: the kernel available from the latest Tumbleweed snapshot installed on the system; nor the one before; nor the current, running kernel Once you have identified the exact kernel version you want to keep using for some time, simply add it as: multiversion.kernels = latest,latest-1,5.13.12-2,running # new: 5.13.12-2 Info Developers recommend specifying kernel versions in the format shown here, the version proper i.e. 5.13.12-2 , instead of the longer kernel-default-5.13.12-2 format, as the former is the standard format used by the libzypp library (the backend to zypper utilities). Now the system should not remove: the kernel available from the latest Tumbleweed snapshot installed on the system; nor the one before; nor the kernel image named 5.13.12-2 (new) the current, running kernel If you have followed through, your system now will accept to use an old kernel name . Now you need to install and expose to the bootloader the actual kernel image bearing the name. Reverting to an old but recent kernel still in the official repositories \u2693\ufe0e If the kernel you have just allowed using the instructions from the previous section exists in the official repository, you simply have to do: $ sudo zypper in <name of the kernel package> where <name of the kernel package> could well be 5.13.12-2-default . Finally, reboot your system and pick the newly installed kernel from the corresponding GRUB2 entry: GRUB2 : Select Advanced options for openSUSE Tumbleweed Select the entry corresponding to the newly installed kernel. Reverting to an old kernel only present in Tumbleweed history \u2693\ufe0e Unfortunately the official repositories do not store a wide gamut of kernels at any time. This means that if you notice that you need to revert to an old kernel after the kernel is gone from the official repositories, you need to manually download the kernel using Tumbleweed's official \"history\" repositories . Just like other packages, kernel packages are organized under Tumbleweed snapshots and CPU architecture. Thus to pick the right kernel package, you need to know: the version of the kernel you need; the Tumbleweed snapshot that shipped (1); your CPU architecture. Note that there is exactly one kernel-default per snapshot per CPU architecture. These informations will enable you to find a directory on a path of type: https://download.opensuse.org/history/<snapshot-you-need>/tumbleweed/repo/oss/<your-cpu-architecture>/ , and in it a kernel-default-<version>.<your-cpu-architecture>.rpm package. Download it and do: $ sudo zypper in -f --oldpackage <path/to/kernel package.rpm> zypper will take care of writing a new GRUB entry for the newly installed old kernel, but it is likely to place the new entry below the entries for the more recent kernel entry or entries you are staying away from. If you want to set the new entry as default, follow the path below and select the entry listed at the end: YaST > Bootloader > Bootloader Options > Default Boot Section > <new kernel entry> (select it) You can now reboot and select the new entry and press Enter to start using the newly installed kernel.","title":"Updating, upgrading, snapshots and best practices"},{"location":"updating_upgrading_reverting/#introduction","text":"Tumbleweed is a rolling-release distribution.

Warning Expect slight differences in System Role and Installation Settings . Minimum system requirements \u2693\ufe0e Any AMD64/Intel* EM64T processor (32-bit processors are not supported). 1 GB physical RAM (4 GB or more strongly recommended). 10 GB available disk space for a minimal installation, 16 GB for a graphical desktop (more is recommended). In case you plan to use Btrfs snapshots, a minimum of 40 GB for the root partition is recommended. Supports most modern sound and graphics cards, 1024 x 768 display resolution (higher recommended). Precautions \u2693\ufe0e Make sure that you have backed up all your data from the disk where you're planning to install openSUSE to. If installing on a separate drive, it is recommended to disconnect the drives not in use. You can always probe foreign operating systems to Grub from a finalized installation with YaST , but selecting the wrong drive to install openSUSE will overwrite the disk destroying the data on it. In case you are using a Network image (Netiso) make sure that you have a strong internet connection. A wired connection is always more reliable than a Wi-Fi one. If installing on a laptop, it is good practice to plug in the AC charger. You are now ready to boot the USB drive, which you have previously prepared - as explained in the Preparing the installation media section - and turn on your computer. Boot from the USB drive and select installation from the boot menu. If you want to see the details of the installation while the installer is booting you can press the ESC key. Info On the left you will see a list of items where you can follow the steps you will take next or have already taken. You can always press Back in case you want to change something you configured earlier. Getting started \u2693\ufe0e Welcome \u2693\ufe0e Language, keyboard and license agreement \u2693\ufe0e Welcome to the YaST installer! Here you can change the language under Language (Alt+L), change the keyboard layout under Keyboard Layout (Alt+K) and you have a chance to test your selected keyboard layout in the field under Keyboard Test (Alt+y). The License Agreement informs you on roles, responsibilities and potential limitations. Network activation \u2693\ufe0e Online repositories If you have an active internet connection over an ethernet cable connected to your computer, right after you pass the \"Language, Keyboard and License Agreement\" section you will be prompted, asking if you want to \"Activate online repositories now?\" .It is recommended to select Yes which will provide you with a list of repositories, pre-selecting the main ones in advance and will download updated packages from the online repository during the installation. If you're on a metered connection you press \"No\". Network settings \u2693\ufe0e You can skip this part if: * you have an active wired internet connection which can be automatically configured by the system; or * you're not planning to use online repositories during the installation process and rely on the packages provided by the DVD installer. If you don't have a network connection -- because you have don't have an ethernet port or you're using wireless connections only -- you will be prompted to configure your network settings. By default the YaST system installer is using Wicked as the network controller. Keep in mind that if you choose to use Network Manager (NM) instead of Wicked , your network configuration will not be transferred from Wicked to Network Manager . You will see a list of available network adapters in a list from which you can select the one that you wish to configure and press Edit . In case of configuring a wireless adapter you will see the Wireless Specific tab open. Here you can Scan Network , select the name of your wireless network (SSID), select the authentication mode -- which in most cases will be WPA-PSK \"home\" -- and input your password. On the Addresses tab you will be able to configure the IP address of your adapter. You can select Dynamic Address in which case you will receive an address from your router/other dhcp server on your network or Statically Assigned IP Address in which case you need to type an ip address, a subnet mask and a hostname. Click Next when finished. Info Wireless networks configured here will be transferred to the finalized system as well, regardless the solution you are choosing to use to manage your connections. If you configured a statically assigned IP address: 1. Switch to the Routing tab. 2. Press Add , add your default gateway address and select the network adapter to which you want this route assigned to. 3. Press OK then Next to apply your changes and continue the installation. Online repositories \u2693\ufe0e List of online repositories \u2693\ufe0e These repositories are the following: Update Repository (Non-OSS) : Non-free -- as in Free Open-Source Software (FOSS) -- update repository. Provides security and maintenance updates for the distribution. Selected by default. Non-OSS Repository : Non-free repository. Provides packages like Steam. Selected by default. Main Update Repository : Main free -- as in FOSS -- update repository. Provides security and maintenance updates for the distribution. Selected by default. Main Repository : Main free repository provides FOSS only. Selected by default. Update Repository (Debug) : A repository for those who want to debug application updates for openSUSE, for experts only. Untested Updates : Security and maintenance updates that requires testing. Add this repository if you want to participate in testing. Source Repository : Provides all source packages in the distribution, for experts only. Debug Repository : A repository for those who want to debug applications for openSUSE, for experts only. Info Keep in mind that if you're on a metered network and you choose to add the online repos, the installer will download packages with newer versions. System role \u2693\ufe0e At this section of the preparation you can select from a list of predefined use cases which will tailor the system for the selected scenario. It is recommended to take a look at the Choosing the right image page prior to continuing as it provides a brief explanation of desktop environments. Do note if you're using a DVD installer without an active internet connection, some of the listed desktop environments will not be available. Desktop with KDE Plasma : the Plasma desktop with KDE applications. Desktop with GNOME : the GNOME desktop with GNOME applications. Generic Desktop : IceWM, a minimal desktop environment with minimal amount of packages. Server : A server installation without providing any graphical environment. Not recommended for inexperienced users. Transactional Server : A server installation with a read-only root filesystem in an immutable server style. This will provide atomic, automatic updates and packages can be installed with transactional-update only. Not recommended for inexperienced users. Select one and press Next to continue. Disk \u2693\ufe0e Suggested Partitioning \u2693\ufe0e Guided Setup \u2693\ufe0e Expert Partitioner \u2693\ufe0e About partition schemes \u2693\ufe0e Most Linux distributions use the same \"base\" partition scheme: a bootloader partition , hosting a small program called a bootloader , whose purpose is to take over from the UEFI/BIOS of your computer and set up the initial conditions for your operating system to get running a main data partition (or OS partition ), which is where the operating system (i.e. Leap ) is installed, optionally along with your personal user data. (recommended but not necessary) a swap partition of the size of your machine's RAM, + 1 GB If you are not interested in keeping whatever data or operating system is installed on the target machine, you can simply proceed with the base partition scheme. In that cases, simply run the installer and, on the Disk screen, pick the Suggested Partitioning option, and accept all recommendations there. Chances are, however, that you will want to install Leap on a disk with an already functional operating system (i.e. Windows, macOS, or another Linux distribution). Or that you will want to install more operating systems alongside Leap easily and reliably in the future. These families of scenarios require some extra steps with respect to the \"base\" partition scheme above. Installing Leap alongside pre-existent Windows partitions \u2693\ufe0e If you have Windows installed already, you are likely to have the following (physical) partitions already: one 'recovery partition', about 500 MB large, usually using the Fat32 filesystem (we won't consider it further as it is not relevant to what comes next) one 'Windows data' partition, usually using the Fat32 filesystem, hosting both Windows and your user data (you want to leave it untouched) one 'Windows bootloader' partition, about 100 MB large, using the Fat32 filesystem, hosting the Windows bootloader. We recommend adding to these physical partitions a single 'Leap OS' partition, at least 40 GB large, using the Btrfs filesystem. Please scroll down to pick a filesystem for data partitions to for more details as to why we recommend Btrfs . Info The 'Leap OS' partition will host the Leap bootloader under the /boot subvolume, the operating system directly under / and your user data under the /home subvolume. Do note that, by default, a /home directory will be installed to store your user data. Also by default, this directory will be excluded from the snapshotting system, which means that there will be no Btrfs backups for your user data. This permits rollbacks between snapshots to proceed smoothly, leaving your user data in no incoherent state. This also means that you will need to manually manage your user data back ups . Alternatively, you might want to install your user data under a separate partition, also mounted as /home , using any file system of your liking. This might come in handy if you plan on using multiple operating systems reading from, and writing to, a single user data partition. Whichever option you choose, you can refer to the following instructions: Step by step: Expert partitioning for Windows From the Disk view, select Expert Partitioner Click the Add Partition button (bottom left-hand side) Assign it at least 40 GBs, and set its filesystem to Btrfs , and the mount point to / . You could label this partition 'Leap OS'. If it is not set already, set the /boot/efi flag your 'Windows bootloader' partition (the ~100MB partition probably using the Fat32 filesystem) (recommended) Add a swap partition with a size equal to your current RAM + 1 GB. Info Even though this makes no difference from the installer's point of view, we recommend assigning meaningful labels to each partition, to make them easier to reidentify them. The result should look like this: Check list: Expert partitioning for Windows (old) ... some other Windows partitions ... (old) /boot/efi , Fat32 , ~ 100 MB (new) / , Btrfs , > 40 GB Warning Because you are installing the Leap bootloader on a non-btrfs partition, the bootloader will be outside of the scope of the snapshotting system. This means that you won't be able to rollback from a misconfigured bootloader settings, and that in general rolling back won't suffice to fix issues with your bootloader configuration. See Introduction to snapper for details. Consider also the official documentation on snapper rollbacks. Optionally, you could create a new partition for your user data under /home . This partition would then be easily accessible to other operating systems installed on your machine. If you do so, make sure there is no /home subvolume created inside the partition assigned to / . Info After the installation you will want to switch between Leap and Windows. Use these instructions to learn how to reboot to your UEFI. From there you will be able to select Windows or Leap as boot destination. Installing Leap alongside pre-existent Linux partitions \u2693\ufe0e You can follow the Step by Step from the previous section, making sure that: you flag your already existent bootloader partition as /boot/efi (if it already exists on the disk before installing Leap ) you flag your user data partition as /home , or alternatively, that you apply steps (4 & 5) if you need to have a /home partition outside of / . Warning Make sure there is enough space (>100 MB is fine) on whatever partition you're installing your bootloader(s) to. Resize it if necessary. Check list: Expert partitioning for multiple Linux distributions (old) ... some other partitions ... (old) /boot/efi , preferably Btrfs , > 100 MB (new) / , Btrfs , > 40 GB Optionally, you could create a new partition for your user data under /home . This partition would then be easily accessible to other operating systems installed on your machine. If you do so, make sure there is no /home subvolume created inside the partition assigned to / . Info After the installation you will want to switch between Leap and whichever operating system you're using. Refer to your machine's manufacturer for instructions. If your machine had Windows preinstalled, use these instructions to learn how to reboot to your UEFI. From there you will be able to select the desired boot destination. Installing Leap alongside pre-existent macOS partitions \u2693\ufe0e The installation process for Mac users interested in dual-booting Leap alongside their macOS partitions is simple: Step by step: Expert partitioning for Mac From the Disk view, select Expert Partitioner Click the Add Partition button (bottom left-hand side) Create a new Btrfs partition of at least 100 MB for the Leap bootloader. Set it the /boot/efi mount point. You could label this partition 'Leap bootloader'. Create a new Btrfs partition of at least 40 GBs by repeating (2). Set it the / mount point. You could label this partition 'Leap OS'. (recommended) Create a swap partition with a size equal to your current RAM + 1 GB. Check list: Expert partitioning for macOS (old) ... some macOS partitions ... (new) /boot/efi , Btrfs , > 100 MB (new) / , Btrfs , > 40 GB Optionally, you could create a new partition for your user data under /home . This partition would then be easily accessible to other operating systems installed on your machine. If you do so, make sure there is no /home subvolume created inside the partition assigned to / . Warning Some recent Macs have been reported to ship with firmware lock enabled by default. Refer to this guide to disable it. Info After the installation you will want to switch between Leap and macOS. Simply hold the alt (option) key immediately after restarting and select Leap or macOS. Picking a filesystem for data partitions \u2693\ufe0e The Leap installer allows you to pick among several filesystems for data partitions , which for the purpose of this section we define as any partition mounted as / (root) or having root on its path (i.e. /home ). Among the supported filesystems for data partitions you will find: Btrfs Ext4 XFS However, Btrfs has been the preferred filesystem for all openSUSE distributions for several years. This filesystem boasts a powerful copy-on-write logic, which lies at the heart of openSUSE's approach to stability: Btrfs allows to conveniently create and use snapshots , aka 'restoration points' on Windows (see Introduction to snapper for details). For this reason we highly recommend you to use it for all your data partitions when installing Leap . Info Snapshots take advantage of the copy-on-write logic of Btrfs . On a copy-on write filesystem, submitted changes do not overwrite the previous state; instead, changes are 'moved' to a different location on the disk, so that the location of origin is left unchanged. Together with 'deduplication' rules aimed at minimizing redundancies between file changes, this logic allows for the layering of several versions of an entire filesystem, with each layer representing different sets of changes. These sets of changes thus correspond to meaningful actions from the end user's perspective, such as 'before installing package X', 'before creating subvolume Y', etc. Renouncing Btrfs thus means renouncing this feature. Given that Tumbleweed was designed around this feature, it will not work as intended unless you pick this filesystem. LUKS encryption \u2693\ufe0e If you are installing Leap on a laptop, or generally on any machine accessible to untrusted individuals, we highly recommend protecting your data with a full disk encryption . The price to pay is that doing so will entirely wipe out your drive. The obvious advantage, however, is that this will protect your data with a sound security model. Info Full disk encryption contrasts with partition encryption in that it protects your entire physical drive using cryptographic techniques. For reasons that go beyond the scope of this document, partition encryption is significantly less secure than full disk encryption. In pictures, partition encryption is like locking your house with an old fashioned padlock and hiding the key in a flowerpot lying on the terrace, while full disk encryption is like locking your house with a digital padlock and keeping the code only in your mind. To apply full disk encryption while installing, you can either use the Guided Setup feature or manually create the partition scheme first and then apply encryption. If you do the latter, you can simply reproduce the steps listed below: Step by step: Guided partitioning for LUKS on Btrfs Select Guided Setup from the Disk screen Check Enable Disk Encryption , and enter a strong password in both text fields Then, on the Filesystem Options screen: Select Btrfs . Tick the Enable Snapshots checkbox ( scroll up or see this document to understand the reason why we recommend this). Select Btrfs again as File System Type for your any mount point / partition presented to you by the installer. Alternatively, if you prefer to turn to a different filesystem than Btrfs (typically Ext4 ) follow the following steps: Warning Using Ext4 on either / or /boot will prevent you from using snapper snapshots. Step by step (Guided Setup: LUKS + LVM + Ext4) Select Guided Setup ' from the _Disk screen Check Enable LVM ' and _Enable Disk Encryption , and enter a strong password in both text fields Then, on the Filesystem Options screen: Select Ext4 . Tick the Enable Snapshots checkbox ( scroll up or see this document to understand the reason why we recommend this). Tick the Propose Separate Home LVM Logical Volume checkbox. Select Ext4 again as File System Type for your /home directory. Tick the Propose Separate Swap LVM Logical Volume . Info The recommended setup mentioned here makes use of the cryptsetup utility in conjunction with an LVM partition. cryptsetup is a popular and trusted tool in the Linux community implementing the LUKS Linux kernel standard, using the aes-xts-plain64 encryption standard. As for LVM, it is a partitioning scheme that allows your machine to see multiple physical disks as one single (logical) partition, or vice-versa, to see one unique physical disk as multiple (logical) partitions. LVM & LUKS work well together, with LVM considerably simplifying encryption - decryption operations. Time Zone \u2693\ufe0e Clock and Time Zone \u2693\ufe0e Select your region and the time zone that you want to use for the system. The hardware clock is by default set to UTC. Select Other Settings for other time settings: Manually : Set time and date manually.

Run NTP as daemon : Run NTP as a daemon so the service always runs and starts automatically on boot and sets the time and date based on the received values from the NTP server. Save NTP Configuration : save or discard the NTP configuration into the installed system. User Settings \u2693\ufe0e Local User \u2693\ufe0e At this point you can create a local user or skip that by selecting Skip User Creation you can set up a password for root . You need to fill out the empty fields in order to create a first user: User's Full Name : A human-friendly version of your username, which will be shown in login windows for example. Username : The actual username for your account. This will be used in all login contexts, whether dialogue boxes or terminal prompts, including virtual console (vc) or over Secure Shell (SSH). Password : The password for your user to secure your account. By default you will also use this newly created account to act as the administrator. The password set there will be set for the root user as well. Root user openSUSE creates the root user by default, in contrast to other Linux distributions. To avoid using the same password for both users, untick the Use this password for system administrator checkbox. Clicking Next will take you to the page where you can set a different password for root. At this page you can also import existing SSH public keys. This is useful if you're installing openSUSE over another distribution.

We recommend adding to these physical partitions a single 'Leap OS' partition, at least 40 GB large, using the Btrfs filesystem. Please scroll down to pick a filesystem for data partitions to for more details as to why we recommend Btrfs . Info The 'Leap OS' partition will host the Leap bootloader under the /boot subvolume, the operating system directly under / and your user data under the /home subvolume. Do note that, by default, a /home directory will be installed to store your user data. Also by default, this directory will be excluded from the snapshotting system, which means that there will be no Btrfs backups for your user data. This permits rollbacks between snapshots to proceed smoothly, leaving your user data in no incoherent state. This also means that you will need to manually manage your user data back ups .

It also manages repositories, can perform various queries, and is a command-line interface to ZYpp system management library (libzypp). Show Definitions repository Local or remote directory containing packages and various package information (package metadata). package Software package (RPM package, source package). Patches, patterns, and products are also commonly referred to as different types of packages. patch Represents a package or a group of packages needed to install an update (a bug fix mostly). pattern Represents a group of packages. For example an Http Server pattern would have the dependencies defined so that all packages needed to run and manage an http server would have been triggered for installation when upon installing the pattern. product Represents the whole product (e.g. 'openSUSE Leap 15.3'). What is a Package Manager? \u2693\ufe0e Software is incredibly interconnected. Programming a user interface, a developer's code will specify the location on the screen of widgets, such as buttons or text, and define how these things rearrange when a window is resized. But most code depends on some other code that serves as a 'backend' (often called a library ). For example, an application will rarely describe how to render a button, instead it will ask a library to do that for it. This allows for a number of benefits. Some people specialise on writing button drawing routines while others specialise on using those routines to create feature-full applications. Apps written for Linux use this principle a lot and it opens up a lot of opportunity. If 100 apps all use the same library, we could install that library once and all 100 apps could use that single copy when running. This has the following benefits: We save space! Instead of every graphical application containing the code necessary for drawing a button, we have that code installed once! If a library used by many is found to contain insecure, buggy or slow code, you can fix and update the library and every app that uses it gains that improvement. We don't have to rely on developers tracking the libraries that they use and rebuilding their apps every time one changes. If you improve upon a library in some way, you can exchange the version on your computer with your modified version. Your improvement is then available to all applications that use that library and can adopt your changes. This is a core principle in free software . However, there is a drawback. When installing software, we have to ensure that the libraries that it requires (known as dependencies) are also installed. When removing software, we cannot remove a dependency without checking to make sure that nothing else depends upon it -- or it will break the 'dependency-tree' of the operating system. To visualize the issue, consider the following illustration: lib5 lib6 / \\ / \\ lib1 lib3 lib4 \\ / \\ / softwareA softwareB Let's assume for simplicity that no other software requires lib4 . Under this assumption, if the user remove softwareB, they will want to remove lib4 , but neither lib3 nor lib6 , because the former is directly required by softwareA , while the latter is indirectly required by softwareA via lib3 . In addition to this issue imagine the user updates softwareB so that it ends up depending on a new version of library lib4 , say lib4* . This means that we need to recast the above structure as: lib5 lib6 / \\ / \\ lib1 lib3 lib4 lib4* \\ / \\ / softwareA softwareB(updated) This means that the system must be able to 'see through' the actual versions of each package, so as to understand the path of their dependencies and warn about required alterations. These problems are solved with a package manager. Developers can build applications, libraries and many other things into packages that contain what you want to install and a set of references to any other packages that it depends upon. The package manager is an essential piece of software that downloads, installs, uninstalls and updates packages for you. If you tell the package manager to install Firefox, it will download a package containing the Firefox executable, as well as a number of packages that contain the dependencies of Firefox. It also holds a database of all installed packages so it knows when it can uninstall certain dependencies without breaking software on your computer. Zypper is the name of the package manager used by openSUSE and SUSE Enterprise Linux. Usage \u2693\ufe0e Zypper is a command line tool, meaning that it is used from within the terminal. Installing, updating and removing packages are operations that affect all users on the system and so many of these commands will not work unless they are run as a privileged user. Although special permissions can be granted to individual user accounts, it is simpler to run commands as the root user (the user with the most privilege). Prefixing a command with sudo (e.g. sudo zypper install firefox ) will ask for the password of the root user account and then runs the command as root . Info The components enclosed in brackets are not required, thus the simplest way to execute zypper is to type its name followed by a command. See zypper help for a list of general options and all commands. To get help for a specific command, type zypper help command # zypper [--GLOBAL-OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS] # zypper <SUBCOMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]` Note Whenever Zypper needs input, it lists possible answers in brackets next to the prompt text. To choose the default answer, press < Enter > (the default answer is printed in capitals, with the exception of non-ascii characters). Some prompts also have help available, in which case there is a question mark '?' listed as a possible answer. To make Zypper use the default answers without user interaction, use the --non-interactive global option. Commands \u2693\ufe0e A single command is given to zypper (without a leading -- ) to instruct it on what kind of task it should do. For example zypper install instructs zypper that we want to install something and zypper search instructs zypper that we want to search for a package. Tip The most used zypper commands have shorter aliases; for example, zypper in is the same as zypper install . zypper without any commands or arguments will print a list of commands and options. This manual is a great starting point but it does not cover all possible ways to use zypper. If you want to see all of the options that can be given to each subcommand in zypper, type: zypper <COMMAND> -h and it will show all of the different ways of configuring the command specified in an easy to read way. The Basics \u2693\ufe0e Installing packages \u2693\ufe0e To install a package type: # zypper install packagename or # zypper in packagename This will download the package you specified along with all of its dependencies and install them. If you want to install more than one package, you simply list them all: # zypper in package_1 package_2 ... package_n Searching for packages \u2693\ufe0e In order to install a package, you need to know its name. To search the repositories for a package type: # zypper search packagename or # zypper se packagename This will return a list of packages that contain your search string along with a summary, a type and whether they have been installed. Example: Search for Firefox # zypper se firefox Loading repository data... Reading installed packages... S | Name | Summary | Type ---+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+-------- i+ | MozillaFirefox | Mozilla Firefox Web Browser | package i+ | MozillaFirefox-branding-openSUSE | openSUSE branding of MozillaFirefox | package | MozillaFirefox-branding-upstream | Upstream branding for Firefox | package | MozillaFirefox-buildsymbols | Breakpad buildsymbols for Firefox | package | MozillaFirefox-devel | Devel package for Firefox | package | MozillaFirefox-translations-common | Common translations for Firefox | package | MozillaFirefox-translations-other | Extra translations for Firefox | package | eid-mw-firefox | Firefox Extension for Belgium eID Middleware | package | firefox-esr-branding-openSUSE | openSUSE branding of MozillaFirefox | package | firefox-uget-integrator | Integration of uGet with Firefox | package Note: i or i+ tell us that it is already installed. i+ means installed by request of the user and i means it was installed as a dependency Adding a New Repository \u2693\ufe0e A repository is simply a source of packages. Zypper will already have a few added (the default for either Tumbleweed or Leap) but there are many reasons why you might want to add some more. You might need to install proprietary libraries such as cuda or non-free media codecs. To add a new repository type: zypper addrepo https://somerepo.com/something name or zypper ar https://somerepo.com/something [optional-name] If successful, zypper will report the settings of that repo: URI of the repository If the repository is enabled If the repository will be GPG checked The priority Understanding The Output Enabled / Disabled If a repository is disabled, it means that zypper still knows where it is but will not use it. You can enable repositories globally or for single commands. GPG check If a repository has GPG checks enabled, it means that your computer will save a key, which you will be asked if you trust it the first time you use a repository. After downloading a package, zypper will use this key to make sure that the download succeeded and the package is not corrupted. It also verifies that the package is authentic. If a hacker intercepts a package download in an attempt to load malicious software onto your computer, the evil package will fail the GPG check. Priority If two repositories contain the same package and you ask zypper to install it, it will automatically use a repository with a higher priority (lower number). Autorefresh If autorefresh is on, zypper will automatically download a fresh list of packages from the repository to ensure that it isn't going to give you out of date information or packages. Example: Adding the cuda Leap repo # sudo zypper ar https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/opensuse15/x86_64/cuda-opensuse15.repo cuda [sudo] password for root: Adding repository 'cuda' ..................................................................................[done] Repository 'cuda' successfully added URI : https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/opensuse15/x86_64 Enabled : Yes GPG Check : Yes Autorefresh : No Priority : 99 (default priority) Repository priorities are without effect. All enabled repositories share the same priority. Removing Repositories \u2693\ufe0e You might decide that you no longer need a repository. Maybe you broke your nvidia graphics card and feel that having the cuda repository just slows down zypper operations. You can remove a repository typing # zypper removerepo reponame or # zypper rr reponame Example: Removing the cuda repository # sudo zypper rr cuda [sudo] password for root: Removing repository 'cuda' ...............................................[done] Repository 'cuda' has been removed. Listing Repositories \u2693\ufe0e To list all of the installed repositories type: # zypper repos # zypper lr This will display a table containing information and names of all the added repos Example: Listing repositories # zypper lr Repository priorities are without effect. All enabled repositories share the same priority. # | Alias | Name | Enabled | GPG Check | Refresh --+-------------------+---------------------------+---------+-----------+-------- 1 | repo-debug | Debug Repository | No | ---- | ---- 2 | repo-debug-update | Update Repository (Debug) | No | ---- | ---- 3 | repo-oss | Main Repository | Yes | (r ) Yes | Yes 4 | repo-source | Source Repository | No | ---- | ---- 5 | repo-update | Main Update Repository | Yes | (r ) Yes | Yes Info See the info box in Adding a New Repository to understand the output Removing Packages \u2693\ufe0e Sometimes you will want to remove packages. To achieve this, type: # zypper remove package or # zypper rm package Tip If your aim is to save space, you may want to add -u or --clean-deps e.g. sudo zypper rm -u firefox to remove the unneeded dependencies as well. Just like when installing, you can remove multiple packages at a time: # zypper rm package_1 package_2 ... package_n Refreshing your repositories \u2693\ufe0e Your computer stores a list of packages that each repository provides and metadata to help it work out what each package depends on. This is so that when you instruct zypper to do something, it can calculate the steps it will take without having to make many slow web requests. For some repositories, this offline list is automatically kept up to date (called autorefresh), but a lot of the time you will want to update this offline list yourself. Before updating, after adding a repository and before installing a package it is a good idea to update this list. You update it by typing: # zypper refresh or # zypper ref Updating Your Computer \u2693\ufe0e There are three different types of update that you can do with zypper Standard Update Patch Updates Distro Upgrade Standard updates simply check to see if newer versions of your packages exist in the repository. If there is a newer version, it will download and install it. Patches are groups of package updates. They are categorised so that you can see why they are being updated. For example, often, when you ask zypper to list available patches, some will be labelled as security patches. This means that they fix a certain security problem that has been discovered in some packages on your system. Distro upgrades do not only update the packages on your system, but also change the source that you get your packages from. This is used mostly on Tumbleweed. The build server where Tumbleweed packages are built is a bit chaotic; packages are updated at an extremely high speed. A consequence of this is that incompatibilities between new packages emerge all over the place. So how does Tumbleweed stay so stable? In regular intervals, a stable snapshot of the Tumbleweed packages is found and frozen for a short amount of time. Tumbleweed users use the distro upgrade feature of zypper to get their updates and so they change their distribution to the newest snapshot. This means that zypper changes repositories to point to the newer snapshot, and then updates all the packages with respect to the new snapshot. This means that Tumbleweed users can enjoy incredibly up to date packages without having to deal with too much instability. Distro-upgrades can be used by leap users to upgrade version (for example, upgrading Leap 15.1 to 15.2). See here for more details. Don't be intimidated by the number of options available to you for updating. The golden rule is if you are on Tumbleweed, do distro-upgrades and if you are on leap do normal upgrades. The exception to this rule is if you are in charge of a production system, such as a web-server (or any system where the only things scarier than change are security issues) then use patches to ensure that only the minimum amount of your system is touched by updates. Listing Updates \u2693\ufe0e To list all of packages that have updates waiting for them, type: # zypper list-updates or # zypper lu Zypper will print out a table that shows you the updatable packages, the repos they come from, the installed versions and the available versions. Example: Listing updates # zypper lu Loading repository data... Reading installed packages...

And this is done, just like with installing and removing, by listing the packages you want to update after the command: # zypper up package_1 package_2 ... package_n Checking for patches \u2693\ufe0e To check for available patches, type: # zypper patch-check or # zypper pchk This will print out a table that shows the number of patches available for your system and how important they are Example: Checking for patches # sudo zypper pchk Loading repository data...

Programming a user interface, a developer's code will specify the location on the screen of widgets, such as buttons or text, and define how these things rearrange when a window is resized. But most code depends on some other code that serves as a 'backend' (often called a library ). For example, an application will rarely describe how to render a button, instead it will ask a library to do that for it. This allows for a number of benefits. Some people specialise on writing button drawing routines while others specialise on using those routines to create feature-full applications. Apps written for Linux use this principle a lot and it opens up a lot of opportunity. If 100 apps all use the same library, we could install that library once and all 100 apps could use that single copy when running. This has the following benefits: We save space! Instead of every graphical application containing the code necessary for drawing a button, we have that code installed once! If a library used by many is found to contain insecure, buggy or slow code, you can fix and update the library and every app that uses it gains that improvement. We don't have to rely on developers tracking the libraries that they use and rebuilding their apps every time one changes. If you improve upon a library in some way, you can exchange the version on your computer with your modified version. Your improvement is then available to all applications that use that library and can adopt your changes. This is a core principle in free software . However, there is a drawback. When installing software, we have to ensure that the libraries that it requires (known as dependencies) are also installed. When removing software, we cannot remove a dependency without checking to make sure that nothing else depends upon it -- or it will break the 'dependency-tree' of the operating system. To visualize the issue, consider the following illustration: lib5 lib6 / \\ / \\ lib1 lib3 lib4 \\ / \\ / softwareA softwareB Let's assume for simplicity that no other software requires lib4 . Under this assumption, if the user remove softwareB, they will want to remove lib4 , but neither lib3 nor lib6 , because the former is directly required by softwareA , while the latter is indirectly required by softwareA via lib3 . In addition to this issue imagine the user updates softwareB so that it ends up depending on a new version of library lib4 , say lib4* . This means that we need to recast the above structure as: lib5 lib6 / \\ / \\ lib1 lib3 lib4 lib4* \\ / \\ / softwareA softwareB(updated) This means that the system must be able to 'see through' the actual versions of each package, so as to understand the path of their dependencies and warn about required alterations. These problems are solved with a package manager. Developers can build applications, libraries and many other things into packages that contain what you want to install and a set of references to any other packages that it depends upon. The package manager is an essential piece of software that downloads, installs, uninstalls and updates packages for you. If you tell the package manager to install Firefox, it will download a package containing the Firefox executable, as well as a number of packages that contain the dependencies of Firefox. It also holds a database of all installed packages so it knows when it can uninstall certain dependencies without breaking software on your computer. Zypper is the name of the package manager used by openSUSE and SUSE Enterprise Linux.","title":"What is a Package Manager?"},{"location":"zypper/#usage","text":"Zypper is a command line tool, meaning that it is used from within the terminal. Installing, updating and removing packages are operations that affect all users on the system and so many of these commands will not work unless they are run as a privileged user. Although special permissions can be granted to individual user accounts, it is simpler to run commands as the root user (the user with the most privilege). Prefixing a command with sudo (e.g. sudo zypper install firefox ) will ask for the password of the root user account and then runs the command as root . Info The components enclosed in brackets are not required, thus the simplest way to execute zypper is to type its name followed by a command. See zypper help for a list of general options and all commands. To get help for a specific command, type zypper help command # zypper [--GLOBAL-OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS] # zypper <SUBCOMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]` Note Whenever Zypper needs input, it lists possible answers in brackets next to the prompt text. To choose the default answer, press < Enter > (the default answer is printed in capitals, with the exception of non-ascii characters). Some prompts also have help available, in which case there is a question mark '?' listed as a possible answer. To make Zypper use the default answers without user interaction, use the --non-interactive global option.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"zypper/#commands","text":"A single command is given to zypper (without a leading -- ) to instruct it on what kind of task it should do.

Zypper will already have a few added (the default for either Tumbleweed or Leap) but there are many reasons why you might want to add some more. You might need to install proprietary libraries such as cuda or non-free media codecs. To add a new repository type: zypper addrepo https://somerepo.com/something name or zypper ar https://somerepo.com/something [optional-name] If successful, zypper will report the settings of that repo: URI of the repository If the repository is enabled If the repository will be GPG checked The priority Understanding The Output Enabled / Disabled If a repository is disabled, it means that zypper still knows where it is but will not use it. You can enable repositories globally or for single commands. GPG check If a repository has GPG checks enabled, it means that your computer will save a key, which you will be asked if you trust it the first time you use a repository. After downloading a package, zypper will use this key to make sure that the download succeeded and the package is not corrupted. It also verifies that the package is authentic. If a hacker intercepts a package download in an attempt to load malicious software onto your computer, the evil package will fail the GPG check. Priority If two repositories contain the same package and you ask zypper to install it, it will automatically use a repository with a higher priority (lower number). Autorefresh If autorefresh is on, zypper will automatically download a fresh list of packages from the repository to ensure that it isn't going to give you out of date information or packages.

For some repositories, this offline list is automatically kept up to date (called autorefresh), but a lot of the time you will want to update this offline list yourself. Before updating, after adding a repository and before installing a package it is a good idea to update this list. You update it by typing: # zypper refresh or # zypper ref","title":"Refreshing your repositories"},{"location":"zypper/#updating-your-computer","text":"There are three different types of update that you can do with zypper Standard Update Patch Updates Distro Upgrade Standard updates simply check to see if newer versions of your packages exist in the repository. If there is a newer version, it will download and install it. Patches are groups of package updates. They are categorised so that you can see why they are being updated. For example, often, when you ask zypper to list available patches, some will be labelled as security patches. This means that they fix a certain security problem that has been discovered in some packages on your system. Distro upgrades do not only update the packages on your system, but also change the source that you get your packages from. This is used mostly on Tumbleweed. The build server where Tumbleweed packages are built is a bit chaotic; packages are updated at an extremely high speed. A consequence of this is that incompatibilities between new packages emerge all over the place. So how does Tumbleweed stay so stable? In regular intervals, a stable snapshot of the Tumbleweed packages is found and frozen for a short amount of time. Tumbleweed users use the distro upgrade feature of zypper to get their updates and so they change their distribution to the newest snapshot. This means that zypper changes repositories to point to the newer snapshot, and then updates all the packages with respect to the new snapshot. This means that Tumbleweed users can enjoy incredibly up to date packages without having to deal with too much instability. Distro-upgrades can be used by leap users to upgrade version (for example, upgrading Leap 15.1 to 15.2). See here for more details. Don't be intimidated by the number of options available to you for updating. The golden rule is if you are on Tumbleweed, do distro-upgrades and if you are on leap do normal upgrades. The exception to this rule is if you are in charge of a production system, such as a web-server (or any system where the only things scarier than change are security issues) then use patches to ensure that only the minimum amount of your system is touched by updates.","title":"Updating Your Computer"},{"location":"zypper/#listing-updates","text":"To list all of packages that have updates waiting for them, type: # zypper list-updates or # zypper lu Zypper will print out a table that shows you the updatable packages, the repos they come from, the installed versions and the available versions.

Install packages with specified capabilities or RPM files with specified location. A capability is NAME[.ARCH][OP<VERSION>], where OP is one of <, <=, =, >=, >. Command options: -t, --type <TYPE> Type of package (package, patch, pattern, product). -n, --name Select packages by plain name, not by capability. Default: false -C, --capability Select packages solely by capability. Default: false --details Show the detailed installation summary. Default: false --from <ALIAS|#|URI> Select packages from the specified repository. --oldpackage Allow to replace a newer item with an older one. Handy if you are doing a rollback. Unlike --force it will not enforce a reinstall. Default: false --allow-unsigned-rpm Silently install unsigned rpm packages given as commandline parameters. Default: false -f, --force Install even if the item is already installed (reinstall), downgraded or changes vendor or architecture. Default: false -r, --repo <ALIAS|#|URI> Work only with the specified repository. -y, --no-confirm Don't require user interaction. Alias for the --non-interactive global option. Default: false -D, --dry-run Don't change anything, just report what would be done. A meaningful file conflict check can only be performed if used together with '--download-only'. Default: false --replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace files from other, already installed, packages. Default is to treat file conflicts as an error. --download-as-needed disables the fileconflict check. Default: false -l, --auto-agree-with-licenses Automatically say 'yes' to third party license confirmation prompt. See 'man zypper' for more details. Default: false --download <MODE> Set the download-install mode. Available modes: only, in-advance, in-heaps, as-needed Default: DownloadDefault -d, --download-only Only download the packages, do not install. Solver options --debug-solver Create a solver test case for debugging. --force-resolution Force the solver to find a solution (even an aggressive one) rather than asking. -R, --no-force-resolution Do not force the solver to find a solution, let it ask. --solver-focus <MODE> Set the solvers general attitude when resolving a job. --recommends Install also recommended packages in addition to the required ones. --no-recommends Do not install recommended packages, only required ones. Expert options --allow-downgrade --no-allow-downgrade Whether to allow downgrading installed resolvables. --allow-name-change --no-allow-name-change Whether to allow changing the names of installed
